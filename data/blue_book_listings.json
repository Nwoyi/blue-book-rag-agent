    "full_text": "1.00 Musculoskeletal Disorders\nA.\nWhich musculoskeletal disorders do we evaluate under these listings?\n1. We evaluate disorders of the skeletal spine (vertebral column) or of the upper \n                            or lower extremities that affect musculoskeletal functioning under these listings. We use the term “skeletal” when we are referring to the structure of the bony skeleton. \n                            The\nskeletal spine\nrefers to the bony structures, ligaments, and discs making up the spine. \n                            We refer to the skeletal spine in some musculoskeletal listings to differentiate it from the\nneurological spine\n(see\n1.00B1\n). \n                            Musculoskeletal disorders may be congenital or acquired, and may include deformities, amputations, or other abnormalities. \n                            These disorders may involve the bones or major joints; or the tendons, ligaments, muscles, or other soft tissues.\n2. We evaluate soft tissue injuries (including burns) or abnormalities that are under continuing surgical management \n                            (see\n1.00O1\n). The injuries or abnormalities may affect any part of the body, including the face and skull.\n3. We evaluate curvatures of the skeletal spine that affect musculoskeletal functioning under\n1.15\n.\n                            If a curvature of the skeletal spine is under continuing surgical management (see\n1.00O1\n),\n                            we will evaluate it under\n1.21\nusing our rules for determining medical equivalence.\n                            See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.\nB.\nWhich related disorders do we evaluate under other listings?\n1. We evaluate a disorder or injury of the skeletal spine that results in damage to, and neurological dysfunction of, \n                            the spinal cord and its associated nerves (for example, paraplegia or quadriplegia) \n                            under the listings in\n11.00\n.\n2. We evaluate inflammatory arthritis (for example, rheumatoid arthritis) \n                            under the listings in\n14.00\n.\n3. We evaluate curvatures of the skeletal spine that interfere with your ability to breathe\n                            under the listings in\n3.00\n,\n                            impair myocardial function under the listings in\n4.00\n,\n                            or result in social withdrawal or depression under the listings in\n12.00\n.\n4. We evaluate non-healing or pathological fractures due to cancer,\n                            whether it is a primary site or metastases,\n                            under the listings in\n13.00\n.\n5. We evaluate the leg pain associated with peripheral vascular claudication and foot ulceration associated with peripheral arterial disease\n                            under the listings in\n4.00\n.\n6. We evaluate burns that do not require continuing surgical management \n                            under the listings in\n8.00\n.\nC.\nWhat evidence do we need to evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder?\n1.\nGeneral.\nWe need objective medical evidence from an acceptable medical source to establish that you have a medically\n                            determinable musculoskeletal disorder. We also need evidence from both medical and nonmedical sources, who can describe how you function,\n                            to assess the severity and duration of your musculoskeletal disorder.\n                            We will determine the extent and kinds of evidence we need from medical and nonmedical sources based on the individual facts about your disorder.\n                            For our basic rules on evidence,\n                            see §§\n404.1512\n,\n404.1513\n,\n404.1520b\n,\n416.912\n,\n416.913\n, and\n416.920b\nof this chapter.\n                            For our rules on evidence about your symptoms,\n                            see §§\n404.1529\nand\n416.929\nof this chapter.\n2.\nPhysical examination report(s).\nIn the report(s) of your physical examination, \n                            we require a medical source’s detailed description of the orthopedic, neurologic, \n                            or other objective clinical findings appropriate to your specific musculoskeletal disorder from his or her direct observations during your physical examination. \n                            We will not accept a report of your statements about your symptoms and limitations in place of the medical source’s report of objective clinical findings. \n                            We will not use findings on imaging or other diagnostic tests \n                            (see\n1.00C3\n) as a substitute for findings on physical examination.\na. When the medical source reports that a clinical test sign(s) is positive, unless we have evidence to the contrary, we will assume that he or she performed the test properly and accept the medical source’s interpretation of the test. For example, we will assume a straight-leg raising test was conducted properly (that is, in sitting and supine positions), even if the medical source does not specify the positions in which the test was performed.\nb. If you use an assistive device (see\n1.00C6\n), \n                            the report must support the medical need for the device.\nc. If your musculoskeletal disorder causes a reduction in muscle strength, the report must document measurement of the strength of the muscle(s) in question. The measurement should be based on a muscle strength grading system that is considered medically acceptable based on your age and impairments. For example, a grading system of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating complete loss of strength and 5 indicating maximum strength or equivalent medically acceptable scale (see Table 1). Reduction in muscle strength is demonstrated by evidence that your muscle strength is less than active range of motion (ROM) against gravity with maximum resistance. If the reduction in muscle strength involves one or both of your hands, the report must also document measurements of grip and pinch strength.\nTable 1 - Grading System of Muscle Function\nGrade\nFunction of the Muscle\n0\nNone\nNo visible or palpable contraction.\n1\nTrace\nVisible or palpable contraction with no motion.\n2\nPoor\nActive ROM with gravity eliminated.\n3\nFair\nActive ROM against gravity only, without resistance.\n4\nGood\nActive ROM against gravity, moderate resistance.\n5\nNormal\nActive ROM against gravity, maximum resistance.\n3.\nImaging and other diagnostic tests.\na.\nImaging\nrefers to medical imaging techniques, such as x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radionuclide scanning. For the purpose of these listings, the imaging must be consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice as the proper technique to support the evaluation of the disorder.\nb. Findings on imaging must have lasted, or be expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\nc. Imaging and other diagnostic tests can provide evidence of physical abnormalities; however, these abnormalities may correlate poorly with your symptoms, including pain, or with your musculoskeletal functioning. Accordingly, we will not use findings on imaging or other diagnostic tests as a substitute for findings on physical examination about your ability to function, nor can we infer severity or functional limitations based solely on such tests.\nd. For our rules on purchasing imaging and other diagnostic tests,\n                            see §§\n404.1519k\n,\n404.1519m\n,\n416.919k\n, and\n416.919m\nof this chapter.\n4.\nOperative reports.\nIf you have had a surgical procedure, we need a copy of the operative report, including details of the findings at surgery and information about any medical complications that may have occurred. If we do not have the operative report, we need confirmatory evidence of the surgical procedure from a medical source (for example, detailed follow-up reports or notations in the medical records concerning the surgical procedure in your medical history).\n5.\nEffects of treatment.\na.\nGeneral.\nTreatments for musculoskeletal disorders may have beneficial or adverse effects, and responses to treatment vary from person to person. We will evaluate all of the effects of treatment (including surgical treatment, medications, and therapy) on the symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of your musculoskeletal disorder, and on your musculoskeletal functioning.\nb.\nResponse to treatment.\nTo evaluate your musculoskeletal functioning in response to treatment, we need the following: A description, including the frequency of the administration, of your medications; the type and frequency of therapy you receive; and a description of your response to treatment and any complications you experience related to your musculoskeletal disorder. The effects of treatment may be temporary or long-term. We need information over a sufficient period to determine the effects of treatment on your current musculoskeletal functioning and permit reasonable projections about your future functioning. We will determine the amount of time that constitutes a sufficient period in consultation with a medical consultant on a case-by-case basis.  In some cases, we will need additional evidence to make an assessment about your response to treatment. Your musculoskeletal disorder may meet or medically equal one of these listings regardless of whether you were prescribed opioid medication, or whether you were prescribed opioid medication and did not follow this prescribed treatment.\n6.\nAssistive devices.\na.\nGeneral.\nAn assistive device, for the purposes of these listings, is any device that you use to improve your stability, dexterity,\n                            or mobility. An assistive device can be worn\n                            (see\n1.00C6b\nand\n1.00C6c\n),\n                            hand-held (see\n1.00C6d\n),\n                            or used in a seated position (see\n1.00C6e\n).\n                            When we use the phrase “documented medical need,” we mean that there is evidence from a medical source that supports your medical need for an assistive device\n                            (see\n1.00C2b\n) for a continuous period of at least 12 months\n                            (see\n1.00C6a\n).\n                            This evidence must describe any limitation(s) in your upper or lower extremity functioning and the circumstances for which you need to use the assistive device.\n                            We do not require that you have a specific prescription for the assistive device.\nb.\nProsthesis(es).\nA prosthesis is a wearable device, such as an artificial limb, that takes the place of an absent body part.\n                            If you have a prosthesis(es), we need evidence from a medical source documenting your ability to walk,\n                            or perform fine and gross movements (see\n1.00E4\n),\n                            with the prosthesis(es) in place. When amputation(s) involves one or both lower extremities,\n                            it is not necessary for the medical source to evaluate your ability to walk without the prosthesis(es) in place.\n                            If you cannot use your prosthesis(es) due to complications affecting your residual limb(s),\n                            we need evidence from a medical source documenting the condition of your residual limb(s) and the medical basis for your inability to use the device(s).\nc.\nOrthosis(es).\nAn orthosis is a wearable device, such as a brace,\n                            that prevents or corrects a dysfunction or deformity by aligning or supporting the affected body part.\n                            If you have an orthosis(es), we need evidence from a medical source documenting your ability to walk,\n                            or perform fine and gross movements (see\n1.00E4\n),\n                            with the orthosis(es) in place. If you cannot use your orthosis(es),\n                            we need evidence from a medical source documenting the medical basis for your inability to use the device(s).\nd.\nHand-held assistive devices\n. Hand-held assistive devices include walkers, canes, or crutches,\n                            which you hold onto with your hand(s) to support or aid you in walking. When you use a one-handed, hand-held assistive device\n                            (such as a cane) with one upper extremity to walk and you cannot use your other upper extremity for fine or gross movements\n                            (see\n1.00E4\n), the need for the assistive device limits the use of both upper extremities.\n                            If you use a hand-held assistive device, we need evidence from a medical source describing how you walk with the device.\ne.\nWheeled and seated mobility devices\n. Wheeled and seated mobility devices are assistive devices that you use in a seated position,\n                            such as manual wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, rollators, and power operated vehicles.\n                            If you use a wheeled and seated mobility device,\n                            we need evidence from a medical source describing the type of wheeled and seated mobility device that you use and how you use the assistive device including\n                            any customizations or modifications to the assistive device itself or for your use of the assistive device.\n                            For example, if you use a wheelchair that typically requires the use of both hands but has been customized for your use with one hand,\n                            then we will evaluate your use of the assistive device using the criteria in\n1.00E3b\nand not\n1.00E3a\n.\n(i)\nWheeled and seated mobility devices involving the use of both hands\n. Some wheeled and seated mobility devices involve the use of both hands to use the assistive device (for example, most manual wheelchairs). If you use a wheeled and seated mobility device that involves the use of both hands, then the need for the assistive device limits the use of both upper extremities.\n(ii)\nWheeled and seated devices involving the use of one hand\n.\n                            Some wheeled and seated mobility devices involve the use of one hand to use the assistive device\n                            (for example, most motorized wheelchairs). If you use a wheeled and seated mobility device that involves the use of one upper extremity\n                            and you cannot use your other upper extremity for fine or gross movements (see\n1.00E4\n),\n                            then the need for the assistive device limits the use of both upper extremities.\n7.\nLongitudinal evidence\n.\na. The term\npandemic period\nas used in\n1.00C7c\nmeans the period beginning on April 2, 2021, and ending on May 11, 2025. The term\npost-pandemic evaluation period\nas used in\n1.00C7c\nmeans the period beginning on May 12, 2025, and ending on May 11, 2029.\nb. We generally need a longitudinal medical record to assess the severity and duration of your musculoskeletal disorder because the severity of symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings related to most musculoskeletal disorders may improve over time or respond to treatment. Evidence over an extended period will show whether your musculoskeletal functioning is improving, worsening, or unchanging.\nc. For\n1.15\n,\n1.16\n,\n1.17\n,\n1.18\n,\n1.20C\n,\n1.20D\n,\n1.22\n, and\n1.23\n, \n                            all of the required criteria must be present simultaneously, or within a close proximity of time, to satisfy the level of severity needed to meet the listing. The phrase \"within a close proximity of time\" means that all of the relevant criteria must appear in the medical record within a consecutive 4-month period, except for claims determined or decided during the pandemic period or post-pandemic evaluation period. For claims determined or decided during the pandemic period or post-pandemic evaluation period, all of the relevant criteria must appear in the medical record within a consecutive 12-month period. When the criterion is imaging, we mean that we could reasonably expect the findings on imaging to have been present at the date of impairment or date of onset. For listings that use the word \"and\" to link the elements of the required criteria, the medical record must establish the simultaneous presence, or presence within a close proximity of time, of all the required medical criteria. Once this level of severity is established, the medical record must also show that this level of severity has continued, or is expected to continue, for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\n8.\nSurgical treatment and physical therapy\n. For some musculoskeletal disorders, a medical source may recommend surgery or physical therapy (PT).\n                            If you have not yet had the recommended surgery or PT, we will not assume that these interventions will resolve your disorder or improve your functioning.\n                            We will assess each case on an individual basis. Depending on your response to treatment, or your medical sources’ treatment plans,\n                            we may defer our findings regarding the effect of surgery or PT, until a sufficient period has passed to permit proper consideration\n                            or judgment about your future functioning. When necessary,\n                            we will follow the rules on following prescribed treatment in\n                            §§\n404.1530\nand\n416.930\nof this chapter,\n                            including consideration of your reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment.\nD.\nHow do we consider symptoms, including pain, under these listings?\n1. Musculoskeletal disorders may cause pain or other symptoms; however,\n                            your statements about your pain or other symptoms will not alone establish that you are disabled.\n                            We will not substitute an alleged or a reported increase in the intensity of a symptom, such as pain, no matter how severe,\n                            for a medical sign or diagnostic finding present in the listing criteria.\n                            Pain is included as just one consideration in\n1.15A\n,\n1.16A\n, and\n1.18A\n,\n                            but it is not required to satisfy the criteria in\n1.15\n,\n1.16\n, \n                            and\n1.18\n.\n2. To consider your symptom(s),\n                            we require objective medical evidence from an acceptable medical source showing the existence of a medically determinable musculoskeletal impairment that\n                            we could reasonably expect to produce the symptom(s).\n                            See §§\n404.1529\nand\n416.929\nof this chapter for how we evaluate symptoms, including pain, related to your musculoskeletal disorder.\nE.\nHow do we use the functional criteria to evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder under these listings?\n1.\nGeneral\n. The functional criteria are based on impairment-related physical limitations in your ability to use both upper extremities,\n                            one or both lower extremities, or a combination of one upper and one lower extremity.\n                            The required impairment-related physical limitation of musculoskeletal functioning must have lasted, or be expected to last,\n                            for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\n                            We do not use the functional criteria in\n1.20A\n,\n1.20B\n,\n                            or\n1.21\n.\n2.\nWork environment\n. We use the relevant evidence that we have to evaluate your musculoskeletal functioning with respect to the work environment rather than the home environment. For example, an ability to walk independently at home without an assistive device does not, in and of itself, indicate an ability to walk without an assistive device in a work environment.\n3.\nFunctional criteria\n. A musculoskeletal disorder satisfies the functional criteria of a listing when the medical documentation shows the presence of at least one of the impairment-related limitations cited in the listing. The required impairment-related limitation of musculoskeletal functioning must be medically documented by one of the following:\na. A documented medical need (see\n1.00C6a\n) for a walker,\n                            bilateral canes, or bilateral crutches (see\n1.00C6d\n)\n                            or a wheeled and seated mobility device involving the use of both hands\n                            (see\n1.00C6e(i)\n);\nb. An inability to use one upper extremity to independently initiate, sustain, \n                            and complete work-related activities involving fine and gross movements \n                            (see\n1.00E4\n), and a documented medical need (see\n1.00C6a\n) for a one-handed, \n                            hand-held assistive device (see\n1.00C6d\n) that requires the use of your other upper extremity or a wheeled and seated mobility device involving the use of one hand \n                            (see\n1.00C6e(ii)\n);\nc. An inability to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to independently initiate, sustain, \n                            and complete work-related activities involving fine and gross movements \n                            (see\n1.00E4\n).\n4.\nFine and gross movements. Fine\nmovements, for the purposes of these listings, \n                            involve use of your wrists, hands, and fingers; such movements include picking, pinching, manipulating, and fingering.\nGross\nmovements involve use of your shoulders, upper arms, forearms, and hands; \n                            such movements include handling, gripping, grasping, holding, turning, and reaching. \n                            Gross movements also include exertional abilities such as lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. \n                            Examples of performing fine and gross movements include, but are not limited to, taking care of personal hygiene, sorting and handling papers or files, \n                            and placing files in a file cabinet at or above waist level.\nF.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate disorders of the skeletal spine resulting in compromise of a nerve root(s)\n                                (\n1.15\n)?\n1.\nGeneral\n. We consider musculoskeletal disorders such as herniated nucleus pulposus, spinal osteoarthritis (spondylosis),\n                            vertebral slippage (spondylolisthesis), degenerative disc disease, facet arthritis, and vertebral fracture or dislocation. Spinal disorders may cause cervical\n                            or lumbar spine dysfunction when abnormalities of the skeletal spine compromise nerve roots of the cervical spine, a nerve root of the lumbar spine,\n                            or a nerve root of both cervical and lumbar spines. We consider spinal nerve disorders that originate in the nervous system (for example, spinal arachnoiditis),\n                            under the neurological disorders body system,\n11.00\n.\n2.\nCompromise of a nerve root(s)\n. Compromise of a nerve root, sometimes referred to as “nerve root impingement,” is a phrase used when a physical object, such as a tumor, herniated disc, foreign body, or arthritic spur, is pushing on the nerve root as seen on imaging or during surgery. It can occur when a musculoskeletal disorder produces irritation, inflammation, or compression of the nerve root(s) as it exits the skeletal spine between the vertebrae. Related symptoms must be associated with, or follow the path of, the affected nerve root(s).\na.\nCompromise of unilateral nerve root of the cervical spine\n. Compromise of a nerve root as it exits the cervical spine between the vertebrae may affect the functioning of the associated upper extremity. The physical examination reproduces the related symptoms based on radicular signs and clinical tests appropriate to the specific cervical nerve root (for example, a positive Spurling test).\nb.\nCompromise of bilateral nerve roots of the cervical spine\n. Although uncommon, if compromise of a nerve root occurs on both sides of the cervical spinal column, functioning of both upper extremities may be limited.\nc.\nCompromise of a nerve root(s) of the lumbar spine\n. Compromise of a nerve root as it exits the lumbar spine between the vertebrae may limit the functioning of the associated lower extremity. The physical examination reproduces the related symptoms based on radicular signs and clinical tests. When a nerve root of the lumbar spine is compromised, we require a positive straight-leg raising test (also known as a Lasègue test) in both supine and sitting positions appropriate to the specific lumbar nerve root that is compromised.\nG.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate lumbar spinal stenosis resulting in compromise of the cauda equina\n                                (\n1.16\n)?\n1.\nGeneral\n. We consider how pain, sensory changes, and muscle weakness caused by compromise of the cauda equina due to lumbar spinal stenosis affect your functioning. The cauda equina is a bundle of nerve roots that descends from the lower part of the spinal cord. Lumbar spinal stenosis can compress the nerves of the cauda equina, causing sensory changes and muscle weakness that may affect your ability to stand or walk. Pain related to compromise of the cauda equina is nonradicular because it is not typically associated with a specific nerve root (as is radicular pain in the cervical or lumbar spine).\n2.\nCompromise of the cauda equina\ndue to lumbar spinal stenosis can affect your ability to walk or stand because of neurogenic claudication (also known as pseudoclaudication), a condition usually causing nonradicular pain that starts in the low back and radiates bilaterally (or less commonly, unilaterally) into the buttocks and lower extremities (or extremity). Extension of the lumbar spine, which occurs when you walk or stand, may provoke the pain of neurogenic claudication. The pain may be relieved by forward flexion of the lumbar spine or by sitting. In contrast, the leg pain associated with peripheral vascular claudication results from inadequate arterial blood flow to a lower extremity. It occurs repeatedly and consistently when a person walks a certain distance and is relieved when the person rests.\nH.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate reconstructive surgery or surgical arthrodesis of a major weight-bearing joint\n                                (\n1.17\n)?\n1.\nGeneral\n. We consider reconstructive surgery or surgical arthrodesis when an acceptable medical source(s) documents the surgical procedure(s) and associated medical treatments to restore function of, or eliminate motion in, the affected major weight-bearing joint. Reconstructive surgery may be done in a single procedure or a series of procedures directed toward the salvage or restoration of functional use of the affected joint.\n2.\nMajor weight-bearing joints\nare the hip, knee, and ankle-foot. The ankle and foot are considered together as one major joint.\n3.\nSurgical arthrodesis\nis the artificial fusion of the bones that form a joint, essentially eliminating the joint.\nI.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate abnormality of a major joint(s) in any extremity\n                                (\n1.18\n)?\n1.\nGeneral\n. We consider musculoskeletal disorders that produce anatomical abnormalities of major joints of the extremities, which result in functional abnormalities in the upper or lower extremities (for example, osteoarthritis, chronic infections of bones and joints, and surgical arthrodesis of a joint). Abnormalities of the joints include ligamentous laxity or rupture, soft tissue contracture, or tendon rupture, and can cause muscle weakness of the affected joint(s).\na. An\nanatomical\nabnormality is one that is readily observable by a medical source during a physical examination (for example, subluxation or contracture), or is present on imaging (for example, joint space narrowing, bony destruction, ankylosis, or deformity).\nb. A\nfunctional\nabnormality is abnormal motion or instability of the affected joint(s), including limitation of motion, excessive motion (hypermobility), movement outside the normal plane of motion for the joint (for example, lateral deviation), or fixation of the affected joint(s).\n2.\nMajor joint of an upper extremity\nrefers to the shoulder, elbow, and wrist-hand. We consider the wrist and hand together as one major joint.\n3.\nMajor joint of a lower extremity\nrefers to the hip, knee, and ankle-foot. We consider the ankle and hindfoot together as one major joint.\nJ.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate pathologic fractures due to any cause (\n1.19\n)?\nWe consider pathologic fractures of the bones in the skeletal spine, extremities, or other parts of the skeletal system.\n                            Pathologic fractures result from disorders that weaken the bones, making them vulnerable to breakage.\n                            Pathologic fractures may occur with osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta or any other skeletal dysplasias, side effects of medications,\n                            and disorders of the endocrine or other body systems.\n                            Under\n1.19\n, the fractures must have occurred on separate,\n                            distinct occasions, rather than multiple fractures occurring at the same time, but the fractures may affect the same bone(s) multiple times.\n                            There is no required time that must elapse between the fractures, but all three must occur within a 12-month period; for example,\n                            separate incidents may occur within hours or days of each other.\n                            We evaluate non-healing or complex traumatic fractures without accompanying pathology under\n1.22\nor\n1.23\n.\nK.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate amputation due to any cause (\n1.20\n)?\n1.\nGeneral.\nWe consider amputation (the full or partial loss or absence of any extremity) due to any cause including trauma,\n                            congenital abnormality or absence, surgery for treatment of conditions such as cancer or infection, or complications of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus.\n2.\nAmputation of both upper extremities (\n1.20A\n).\nUnder\n1.20A\n, we consider upper extremity amputations that occur at any level at or above the wrists (carpal joints),\n                            up to and including disarticulation of the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint.\n                            If you have had both upper extremities amputated at any level at or above the wrists up to and including the shoulder,\n                            your impairment satisfies the duration requirement in\n                            §§\n404.1509\nand\n416.909\nof this chapter.\n                            For amputations below the wrist,\n                            we will follow the rules described in\n1.00S\n.\n                            We do not evaluate amputations below the wrist under\n1.20A\nbecause the resulting limitation of function of the thumb(s),\n                            finger(s), or hand(s) will vary, depending on the extent of loss and corresponding effect on fine and gross movements.\n3.\nHemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation (\n1.20B\n).\nUnder\n1.20B\n, we consider hemipelvectomy,\n                            which involves amputation of an entire lower extremity through the sacroiliac joint, and hip disarticulation,\n                            which involves amputation of an entire lower extremity through the hip joint capsule and closure of the remaining musculature over the exposed acetabular bone.\n                            If you have had a hemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation,\n                            your impairment satisfies the duration requirement in\n                            §§\n404.1509\nand\n416.909\nof this chapter.\n4.\nAmputation of one upper extremity and one lower extremity (\n1.20C\n).\nUnder\n1.20C\n, we consider the amputation of one upper extremity at any level at or above the wrist and one lower extremity at or above the ankle.\n                            If you have a documented medical need for a one-handed, hand-held assistive device (such as a cane)\n                            or a wheeled and seated mobility device involving the use of one hand (such as a motorized wheelchair),\n                            then you must use your remaining upper extremity to hold the device, making the extremity unavailable to perform other fine and gross movements\n                            (see\n1.00E4\n).\n5.\nAmputation of one lower extremity or both lower extremities with complications of the residual limb(s)\n                                    (\n1.20D\n).\nUnder\n1.20D\n,\n                            we consider the amputation of one lower extremity or both lower extremities at or above the ankle.\n                            We also consider the condition of your residual limb(s), whether you can wear a prosthesis(es)\n                            (see\n1.00C6b\n), and whether you have a documented medical need\n                            (see\n1.00C6a\n) for a hand-held assistive device(s)\n                            (see\n1.00C6d\n) or a wheeled and seated mobility device\n                            (see\n1.00C6e\n).\n                            If you have a non-healing residual limb(s) and are receiving ongoing surgical treatment expected to re-establish or improve function,\n                            and that ongoing surgical treatment has not ended, or is not expected to end, within at least 12 months of the initiation of the surgical management\n                            (see\n1.00L\n), we evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder under\n1.21\n.\nL.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate soft tissue injuries or abnormalities under continuing surgical management\n                                (\n1.21\n)?\n1.\nGeneral.\na. We consider any soft tissue injury or abnormality involving the soft tissues of the body, \n                            whether congenital or acquired, when an acceptable medical source(s) \n                            documents the need for ongoing surgical procedures and associated medical treatments to restore function of the affected body part(s) \n                            (see\n1.00O1\n). Surgical management includes the surgery(ies) itself, \n                            as well as various post-surgical procedures, surgical complications, infections or other medical complications, \n                            related illnesses, or related treatments that delay your attainment of maximum benefit from therapy \n                            (see\n1.00O2\n).\nb. Surgical procedures and associated treatments typically take place over extended periods, which may render you unable to perform work-related activity on a sustained basis. To document such inability, we must have evidence from an acceptable medical source(s) confirming that the surgical management has continued, or is expected to continue, for at least 12 months from the date of the first surgical intervention. These procedures and treatments must be directed toward saving, reconstructing, or replacing the affected part of the body to re-establish or improve its function, and not for cosmetic appearances alone.\nc. Examples include malformations, third- and fourth-degree burns, crush injuries, craniofacial injuries, avulsive injuries, and amputations with complications of the residual limb(s).\nd. We evaluate skeletal spine abnormalities or injuries \n                            under\n1.15\nor\n1.16\n, as appropriate. \n                            We evaluate abnormalities or injuries of bones in the lower extremities \n                            under\n1.17\n,\n1.18\n, \n                            or\n1.22\n. \n                            We evaluate abnormalities or injuries of bones in the upper extremities \n                            under\n1.18\nor\n1.23\n.\n2.\nDocumentation.\nIn addition to the objective medical evidence we need to establish your soft tissue injury or abnormality, we also need all of the following medically documented evidence about your continuing surgical management:\na. Operative reports and related laboratory findings;\nb. Records of post-surgical procedures;\nc. Records of any surgical or medical complications (for example, related infections or systemic illnesses);\nd. Records of any prolonged post-operative recovery periods and related treatments (for example, surgeries and treatments for burns);\ne. An acceptable medical source’s plans for additional surgeries; and\nf. Records detailing any other factors that have delayed, or that an acceptable medical source expects to delay, the saving, restoring, or replacing of the involved part for a continuous period of at least 12 months following the initiation of the surgical management.\n3.\nBurns.\nThird- and fourth-degree burns damage or destroy nerve tissue,\n                            reducing or preventing transmission of signals through those nerves.\n                            Such burns frequently require multiple surgical procedures and related therapies to re-establish or improve function,\n                            which we evaluate under\n1.21\n.\n                            When burns are no longer\nunder continuing surgical management\n(see\n1.00O1\n),\n                            we evaluate the residual impairment(s). When the residual impairment(s) affects the musculoskeletal system, as often occurs in third- and fourth-degree burns,\n                            it can result in permanent musculoskeletal tissue loss, joint contractures, or loss of extremities.\n                            We will evaluate such impairments under the relevant musculoskeletal disorders listing,\n                            for example,\n1.18\nor\n1.20\n.\n                            When the residual impairment(s) involves another body system,\n                            we will evaluate the impairment(s) under the listings in the relevant body system(s).\n4.\nCraniofacial injuries.\nSurgeons may treat craniofacial injuries with multiple surgical procedures. These injuries may affect vision, hearing, speech, and the initiation of the digestive process, including mastication. When the craniofacial injury-related residual impairment(s) involves another body system(s), we will evaluate the impairment(s) under the listings in the relevant body system(s).\nM.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate non-healing or complex fractures of the femur, tibia, pelvis,\n                                or one or more of the talocrural bones (\n1.22\n)?\n1.\nNon-healing fracture.\nA non-healing (nonunion) fracture is a fracture that has failed to unite completely. Nonunion is usually established when a minimum of 9 months has elapsed since the injury and the fracture site has shown no, or minimal, progressive signs of healing for a minimum of 3 months.\n2.\nComplex fracture.\nA complex fracture is a fracture with one or more of the following:\na. Comminuted (broken into many pieces) bone fragments;\nb. Multiple fractures in a single bone;\nc. Bone loss due to severe trauma;\nd. Damage to the surrounding soft tissue;\ne. Severe cartilage damage to the associated joint; or\nf. Dislocation of the associated joint.\n3. When a complex fracture involves soft tissue damage, \n                            the treatment may involve continuing surgical management to restore or improve functioning. \n                            In such cases, we may evaluate the fracture(s) under\n1.21\n.\nN.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate non-healing or complex fracture of an upper extremity\n                                (\n1.23\n)?\n1.\nNon-healing fracture.\nA non-healing (nonunion) fracture is a fracture that has failed to unite completely. Nonunion is usually established when a minimum of 9 months has elapsed since the injury and the fracture site has shown no, or minimal, progressive signs of healing for a minimum of 3 months.\n2.\nComplex fracture.\nA complex fracture is a fracture with one or more of the following:\na. Comminuted (broken into many pieces) bone fragments;\nb. Multiple fractures in a single bone;\nc. Bone loss due to severe trauma;\nd. Damage to the surrounding soft tissue;\ne. Severe cartilage damage to the associated joint; or\nf. Dislocation of the associated joint.\n3. When a complex fracture involves soft tissue damage, \n                            the treatment may involve continuing surgical management to restore or improve functioning. \n                            In such cases, we may evaluate the fracture(s) under\n1.21\n.\nO.\nHow will we determine whether your soft tissue injury or abnormality or your upper extremity fracture is no longer under continuing surgical management\n                                or you have received maximum benefit from therapy?\n1. We will determine that your soft tissue injury or abnormality, \n                            or your upper extremity fracture, is no longer\nunder continuing surgical management\n, \n                            as used in\n1.21\nand\n1.23\n, \n                            when the last surgical procedure or medical treatment directed toward the re-establishment or improvement of function of the involved part has occurred.\n2. We will determine that you have received\nmaximum benefit from therapy\n, \n                            as used in\n1.21\n, \n                            if there are no significant changes in physical findings or on appropriate imaging for any 6-month period after the last surgical procedure or medical treatment. \n                            We may also determine that you have received maximum benefit from therapy if your medical source(s) indicates that further improvement \n                            is not expected after the last surgical procedure or medical treatment.\n3. When you have received maximum benefit from therapy, we will evaluate any impairment-related residual symptoms, signs, \n                            and laboratory findings (including those on imaging), any complications associated with your surgical procedures or medical treatments, \n                            and any residual limitations in your functioning (see\n1.00S\n).\nP.\nHow do we evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder if there is no record of ongoing treatment?\n1. Despite having a musculoskeletal disorder, you may not have received ongoing treatment,\n                            may have just begun treatment, may not have access to prescribed medical treatment, or may not have an ongoing relationship with the medical community.\n                            In any of these situations, you will not have a longitudinal medical record for us to review when we evaluate your disorder and we may ask you to attend\n                            a consultative examination to determine the severity and potential duration of your disorder.\n                            See §§\n404.1519a(b)\nand\n416.919a(b)\nof this chapter.\n2. In some instances, we may be able to assess the severity and duration of your musculoskeletal disorder based on your medical record \n                            and current evidence alone. If the information in your case record is not sufficient to show that you have a musculoskeletal disorder that meets the criteria \n                            of one of the musculoskeletal disorders listings, \n                            we will follow the rules described in\n1.00S\n.\nQ.\nHow do we consider the effects of obesity when we evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder?\nObesity is a medically determinable impairment that is often associated with musculoskeletal disorders. \n                            Obesity increases stress on weight-bearing joints and may contribute to limitation of the range of motion of the skeletal spine and extremities. \n                            The combined effects of obesity with a musculoskeletal disorder can be greater than the effects of each of the impairments considered separately. \n                            We consider the additional and cumulative effects of your obesity when we determine whether you have a severe musculoskeletal disorder, \n                            a listing-level musculoskeletal disorder, a combination of impairments that medically equals the severity of a listed impairment, \n                            and when we assess your residual functional capacity.\nR.\nHow do we evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder if there is evidence establishing a substance use disorder?\nIf we find that you are disabled and there is medical evidence in your case record establishing that you have a substance use disorder,\n                            we will determine whether your substance use disorder is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.\n                            See §§\n404.1535\nand\n416.935\nof this chapter.\nS.\nHow do we evaluate musculoskeletal disorders that do not meet one of these listings?\n1. These listings are only examples of musculoskeletal disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity. \n                            If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have an impairment(s) \n                            that meets the criteria of a listing in another body system.\n2. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing,\n                            we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n                            See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.\n                            If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity.\n                            We proceed to the fourth step and, if necessary, the fifth step of the sequential evaluation process\n                            in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter.\n3. We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter,\n                            as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

    "body_system": "Special Senses and Speech",
    "section_number": "2.00",
    "full_text": "2.00\nSpecial Senses and Speech\nA\n.\nHow do  we evaluate visual disorders?\n1.\nWhat are visual disorders?\nVisual disorders are abnormalities of the eye, the optic nerve, the optic  tracts, or the brain that may cause a loss of visual acuity or visual fields. A  loss of visual acuity limits your ability to distinguish detail, read, or do  fine work. A loss of visual fields limits your ability to perceive visual  stimuli in the peripheral extent of vision.\n2.\nHow do we define statutory blindness?\nStatutory blindness is blindness as defined in sections 216(i)(1) and  1614(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (Act).\na. The Act defines  blindness as central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the  use of a correcting lens. \n                We use your best-corrected central visual acuity for  distance in the better eye when we determine if this definition is met. \n                (For  visual acuity testing requirements, see\n2.00A5\n.)\nb. The Act also provides that an eye that has a visual field limitation such that the widest diameter of  the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees is considered \n                as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. (For visual field testing  requirements,\nsee 2.00A6\n.)\nc. You have statutory blindness only if your visual disorder meets the criteria of\n2.02\nor\n2.03A\n. \n            You  do not have statutory blindness if your visual disorder medically equals the criteria of\n2.02\nor\n2.03A\nor meets or medically equals the\n            criteria of\n2.03B\n,\n2.03C\n,\n2.04A\n, \n                or\n2.04B\nbecause your disability is based on criteria other than those in the statutory definition of blindness.\nBack to Top\n3.\nWhat evidence do we need to establish statutory blindness under title XVI?\nTo establish that you have statutory blindness  under title XVI, we need evidence showing only that your central visual acuity in your better eye or your visual field in your better eye meets the criteria in\n2.00A2\n, provided that those measurements are consistent with the other  evidence in your case record. We do not need documentation of the cause of your blindness.\n                 Also, there is no duration requirement for statutory blindness under title XVI (see §§\n416.981\nand\n416.983\nof this chapter).\n4. What evidence do we need to evaluate visual disorders, including those that result in statutory blindness under title II?\nTo evaluate your visual disorder, we usually need a report of an eye examination that includes measurements of your best-corrected central visual acuity (see\n2.00A5\n) or the extent of your visual fields (see\n2.00A6\n),\n    as appropriate. If you have visual acuity or visual field  loss, we need documentation of the cause of the loss. A standard eye  examination will usually indicate the cause of any visual acuity loss.\n    A standard eye examination can also indicate the cause of some types of visual  field deficits. Some disorders, such as cortical visual disorders, may result in abnormalities that do not appear on a standard eye examination.\n    If the standard eye examination does not indicate the cause of your vision loss, we will request the information used to establish the presence of your visual  disorder.\n    If your visual disorder does not satisfy the criteria in\n2.02\n,\n2.03\n, or\n2.04\n, we will request a description of how your visual disorder affects your ability to function.\nBack to Top\n5. How do we measure best-corrected visual acuity?\na.\nVisual acuity  testing\n.\nWhen we need to measure  your best-corrected central visual acuity (your optimal visual acuity  attainable with the use of a corrective lens), we use visual acuity testing for  distance that was carried out using Snellen methodology or any other testing  methodology that is comparable to Snellen methodology.\n(i) Your best-corrected  central visual acuity for distance is usually measured by determining what you  can see from 20 feet. If your visual acuity is measured for a distance other  than 20 feet, we will convert it to a 20-foot measurement. For example, if your  visual acuity is measured at 10 feet and is reported as 10/40, we will convert  this measurement to 20/80.\n(ii) A visual acuity  recorded as CF (counts fingers), HM (hand motion only), LP or LPO (light  perception or light perception only), or NLP (no light perception) indicates  that no optical correction will improve your visual acuity. If your central  visual acuity in an eye is recorded as CF, HM, LP or LPO, or NLP, we will  determine that your best-corrected central visual acuity is 20/200 or less in  that eye.\n(iii) We will not use the  results of pinhole testing or automated refraction acuity to determine your  best-corrected central visual acuity. These tests provide an estimate of  potential visual acuity but not an actual measurement of your best-corrected  central visual acuity.\nb.\nOther test charts.\nMost test charts that use Snellen methodology do  not have lines that measure visual acuity between 20/100 and 20/200. Some test  charts, such as the Bailey-Lovie or the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy  Study (ETDRS), used mostly in research settings, have such lines. If your  visual acuity is measured with one of these charts, and you cannot read any of  the letters on the 20/100 line, we will determine that you have statutory  blindness based on a visual acuity of 20/200 or less. For example, if your  best-corrected central visual acuity for distance in the better eye is 20/160  using an ETDRS chart, we will find that you have statutory blindness. Regardless  of the type of test chart used, you do not have statutory blindness if you can  read at least one letter on the 20/100 line. For example, if your  best-corrected central visual acuity for distance in the better eye is 20/125+1  using an ETDRS chart, we will find that you do not have statutory blindness  because you are able to read one letter on the 20/100 line.\nc.\nTesting using a specialized lens.\nIn  some instances, you may perform visual acuity testing using a specialized lens,  such as a contact lens. We will use the visual acuity measurements obtained  with a specialized lens only if you have demonstrated the ability to use the  specialized lens on a sustained basis. We will not use visual acuity  measurements obtained with telescopic lenses.\nd.\nCycloplegic refraction\nis an examination of the eye performed after  administering cycloplegic eye drops capable of relaxing the ability of the  pupil to become smaller and temporarily paralyzing the focusing muscles. If  your case record contains the results of cycloplegic refraction, we may use the  results to determine your best-corrected central visual acuity. We will not  purchase cycloplegic refraction.\ne.\nVisual evoked response (VER) testing\nmeasures your response to  visual events and can often detect dysfunction that is undetectable through other types of examinations. \n            If you have an absent response to VER testing in  your better eye, we will determine that your best-corrected central visual acuity is 20/200 or less in that eye and that your visual acuity loss satisfies the \n            criterion in\n2.02\nwhen these test results are consistent with the other  evidence in your case record. If you have a positive response to VER testing in  an eye, we will not use that result to determine your best-corrected central  visual acuity in that eye.\nBack to Top\n6. How do we measure visual fields?\na.\nGeneral.\nWe generally need visual field  testing when you have a visual disorder that could result in visual field loss,  such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, or optic neuropathy, \n            or when you display behaviors that suggest a visual field loss. When we need to measure the  extent of your visual field loss, \n            we use visual field testing (also referred to  as perimetry) carried out using automated static threshold perimetry performed on an acceptable perimeter. \n            (For perimeter requirements, see\n2.00A9\n.)\nb.\nAutomated static threshold perimetry requirements.\n(i) The test must use a  white size III Goldmann stimulus and a 31.5 apostilb (asb) white background (or  a 10 candela per square meter (cd/m\n2\n) white background). The stimuli  test locations must be no more than 6 degrees apart horizontally or vertically.  Measurements must be reported on standard charts and include a description of  the size and intensity of the test stimulus.\n(ii) We measure the  extent of your visual field loss by determining the portion of the visual field  in which you can see a white III4e stimulus. The \"III\" refers to the  standard Goldmann test stimulus size III (4 mm\n2\n), and the  \"4e\" refers to the standard Goldmann intensity filter (0 decibel (dB)  attenuation, which allows presentation of the maximum luminance) used to  determine the intensity of the stimulus.\n(iii) In automated static  threshold perimetry, the intensity of the stimulus varies. The intensity of the  stimulus is expressed in decibels (dB). A perimeter's maximum stimulus  luminance is usually assigned the value 0 dB. We need to determine the dB level  that corresponds to a 4e intensity for the particular perimeter being used. We  will then use the dB printout to determine which points you see at a 4e  intensity level (a \"seeing point\"). For example:\nA.\nWhen the  maximum stimulus luminance (0 dB stimulus) on an acceptable perimeter is 10,000  asb, a 10 dB stimulus is equivalent to a 4e stimulus. Any point you see at 10  dB or greater is a seeing point.\nB.\nWhen the  maximum stimulus luminance (0 dB stimulus) on an acceptable perimeter is 4,000  asb, a 6 dB stimulus is equivalent to a 4e stimulus. Any point you see at 6 dB  or greater is a seeing point.\nC.\nWhen the  maximum stimulus luminance (0 dB stimulus) on an acceptable perimeter is 1,000  asb, a 0 dB stimulus is equivalent to a 4e stimulus. Any point you see at 0 dB  or greater is a seeing point.\nc.\nEvaluation under\n2.03A\n.\nTo determine statutory blindness based on  visual field loss in your better eye (\n2.03A\n), we need the results of a visual field test that measures the central 24 to 30 degrees of your visual field;\n    that is, the area measuring 24 to 30 degrees from the point of fixation.  Acceptable tests include the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 30-2, HFA 24-2, and  Octopus 32.\nd.\nEvaluation under\n2.03B\n.\nTo determine whether your visual field loss meets listing\n2.03B\n, we use the mean deviation or defect (MD) from acceptable automated static threshold \n                perimetry that measures the central 30 degrees of  the visual field. MD is the average sensitivity deviation from normal values  for all measured visual field locations. When using results from HFA tests, \n                which report the MD as a negative number, we use the absolute value of the MD  to determine whether your visual field loss meets listing\n2.03B\n.\n                We cannot use  tests that do not measure the central 30 degrees of the visual field, such as the HFA 24-2, to determine if your impairment meets or medically equals\n2.03B.\ne.\nOther types of perimetry.\nIf the evidence in your case contains  visual field measurements obtained using manual or automated kinetic perimetry, \n                such as Goldmann perimetry or the HFA \"SSA Test Kinetic,\" we can generally use these results if the kinetic test was performed using a white III4e stimulus projected on a white 31.5 asb (10 cd/m\n2\n) \n                background. Automated kinetic perimetry, such as the HFA \"SSA Test  Kinetic,\" does not detect limitations in the central visual field because \n                testing along a meridian stops when you see the stimulus. If your visual  disorder has progressed to the point at which it is likely to result in a significant limitation in the central visual field, \n                such as a scotoma (see\n2.00A6h\n), we will not use\nautomated\nkinetic perimetry to determine the extent of your visual field loss.\n                Instead, we will determine the extent of your visual field loss using automated static  threshold perimetry or manual kinetic perimetry.\nBack to Top\nf.\nScreening tests.\nWe will not use the results of visual field  screening tests, such as confrontation tests, tangent screen tests, or automated static screening tests, to determine that your impairment meets or \n                medically equals a listing or to evaluate your residual functional capacity. We  can consider normal results from visual field screening tests to determine  whether your visual disorder is \n                severe when these test results are consistent with the other evidence in your case record. \n                (See §§\n404.1520(c)\n,\n404.1521\n,\n416.920(c)\n, and\n416.921\nof this chapter.)\n                We will not consider normal test  results to be consistent with the other evidence if the clinical findings indicate that your visual disorder has progressed to the point that it is likely to cause visual field loss,\n                or you have a history of an operative procedure for retinal detachment.\ng.\nUse of corrective lenses.\nYou must not wear eyeglasses during  visual field testing because they limit your field of vision. You may wear  contact lenses to correct your visual acuity during the visual field test to  obtain the most accurate visual field measurements. For this single purpose,  you do not need to demonstrate that you have the ability to use the contact  lenses on a sustained basis.\nh.\nScotoma.\nA scotoma is a field defect or non-seeing area (also  referred to as a “blind spot”) in the visual field surrounded by a normal field  or seeing area. When we measure your visual field, we subtract the length of  any scotoma, other than the normal blind spot, from the overall length of any  diameter on which it falls.\nBack to Top\n7.\nHow do we determine your visual acuity efficiency, visual field efficiency, and visual efficiency?\n.\nGeneral.\nVisual efficiency\n,  a calculated value of your remaining visual function, is the combination of  your\nvisual acuity efficiency\nand  your\nvisual field efficiency\nexpressed as a percentage.\nb.\nVisual acuity  efficiency.\nVisual acuity efficiency is a percentage that corresponds to  the best-corrected central visual acuity for distance in your better eye. See  Table 1.\nTable 1 - Visual Acuity Efficiency\nSnellen best-corrected central visual acuity for distance\nVisual acuity efficiency (%)\n(2.04A)\nEnglish\nMetric\n20/16\n6/5\n100\n20/20\n6/6\n100\n20/25\n6/7.5\n95\n20/30\n6/9\n90\n20/40\n6/12\n85\n20/50\n6/15\n75\n20/60\n6/18\n70\n20/70\n6/21\n65\n20/80\n6/24\n60\n20/100\n6/30\n50\nc.\nVisual field  efficiency.\nVisual field efficiency  is a percentage that corresponds to the visual field in your better eye. \n    Under\n2.03C\n, we require kinetic perimetry to determine your visual field efficiency  percentage.\n    We calculate the visual field efficiency percentage by  adding the number of degrees you see along the eight principal meridians found on a visual field chart\n    (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315) in your better eye and dividing by 5. For example, in Figure 1:\nA.\nThe diagram of the left eye illustrates a visual field, as measured with a III4e stimulus, contracted to 30 degrees in two meridians (180 and 225) and to 20 degrees in the remaining six meridians. The visual efficiency percentage of this field is:  ((2 x 30) + (6 x 20)) / 5 = 36 percent.\nB.\nThe diagram of the right eye illustrates the extent of a normal visual field as measured with a III4e stimulus. The sum of the eight principal meridians of this field is 500 degrees. The visual efficiency percentage of this field is 500 / 5 =  100 percent.\nFigure 1:\nd.\nVisual efficiency.\nUnder\n2.04A\n, we calculate the visual efficiency percentage by multiplying your visual acuity efficiency percentage (see\n2.00A7b\n)\n    by your visual field efficiency percentage (see\n2.00A7c\n) and dividing by 100.\n    For example, if your visual acuity efficiency percentage is 75 and your visual field efficiency percentage is 36, your visual efficiency percentage is: (75 x 36) / 100 = 27 percent.\nBack to Top\n8.\nHow do we determine your visual acuity impairment value, visual field impairment value, and visual impairment value?\na.\nGeneral.\nVisual impairment  value\n, a calculated value of your loss of visual function, is the  combination of your\nvisual acuity  impairment value\nand your\nvisual  field impairment value\n.\nb.\nVisual acuity  impairment value.\nYour visual acuity impairment value corresponds to the  best-corrected central visual acuity for distance in your better eye. See Table  2.\nBack to Top\nTable 2 - Visual Acuity Impairment Value\nSnellen best-corrected central visual acuity for    distance\nVisual acuity impairment value\n(2.04B)\nEnglish\nMetric\n20/16\n6/5\n0.00\n20/20\n6/6\n0.00\n20/25\n6/7.5\n0.10\n20/30\n6/9\n0.18\n20/40\n6/12\n0.30\n20/50\n6/15\n0.40\n20/60\n6/18\n0.48\n20/70\n6/21\n0.54\n20/80\n6/24\n0.60\n20/100\n6/30\n0.70\nc.\nVisual field  impairment value.\nYour visual  field impairment value corresponds to the visual field in your better eye. Using  the MD from acceptable automated static threshold perimetry, we calculate the  visual field impairment value by dividing the absolute value of the MD by 22.  For example, if your MD on an HFA 30-2 is -16, your visual field impairment  value is: |-16| / 22 = 0.73.\nd.\nVisual impairment  value.\nUnder\n2.04B\n, we calculate the visual impairment value by adding your visual acuity impairment value (see\n2.00A8b\n)\n                 and your visual field impairment  value (see\n2.00A8c\n).\n                For example, if your visual acuity impairment value is  0.48 and your visual field impairment value is 0.73, your visual impairment  value is: 0.48 + 0.73 = 1.21.\n9.\nWhat are our requirements for an acceptable  perimeter?\nWe will use results from  automated static threshold perimetry performed on a perimeter that:\na. Uses optical projection to generate the test  stimuli.\nb. Has an internal normative database for  automatically comparing your performance with that of the general population.\nc. Has a statistical analysis package that is able to  calculate visual field indices, particularly MD.\nd. Demonstrates the ability to correctly detect  visual field loss and correctly identify normal visual fields.\ne. Demonstrates good test-retest reliability.\nf. Has undergone clinical validation studies by three  or more independent laboratories with results published in peer-reviewed  ophthalmic journals.\nBack to Top",

    "full_text": "B. How do we evaluate hearing loss?\n1.\nWhat evidence do we need?\na. We need evidence showing that you have a medically determinable impairment that causes your hearing loss and audiometric measurements of the severity of your hearing loss. We generally require  both an otologic examination and audiometric testing to establish that you have  a medically determinable impairment that causes your hearing loss. You should  have this audiometric testing within 2 months of the otologic examination. Once  we have evidence that you have a medically determinable impairment, we can use  the results of later audiometric testing to assess the severity of your hearing  loss without another otologic examination. We will consider your test scores together with any other relevant information we have about your hearing, including information from outside of the test setting.\nb. The otologic examination must be performed by a licensed physician (medical or osteopathic  doctor) or audiologist. It must include your medical history, your description  of how your hearing loss affects you, and the physician’s or audiologist’s  description of the appearance of the external ears (pinnae and external ear  canals), evaluation of the tympanic membranes, and assessment of any middle ear  abnormalities.\nc. Audiometric testing  must be performed by, or under the direct supervision of, a licensed audiologist  or an otolaryngologist.\n2\n. What audiometric testing do we need when you do not have a cochlear implant?\na. We generally need pure tone air conduction and bone conduction testing, speech reception threshold (SRT) testing (also referred to as \"spondee threshold'' or \"ST\"' testing), and word recognition testing (also referred to as \"word discrimination'' or ``speech discrimination'' testing). This testing must be conducted in a sound-treated booth or room and must be in accordance with the most recently published standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Each ear must be tested separately.\nb. You must not wear hearing aids during the testing. \n                Additionally, a person described in\n2.00B1c\nmust perform an otoscopic examination immediately before the audiometric testing.\n                (An\notoscopic examination\nprovides a description of the appearance of your external ear canals and an evaluation of the tympanic membranes.\n                In these rules, we use the term to include otoscopic examinations performed by physicians and otoscopic inspections performed by audiologists and others.)\n                The otoscopic examination must show that there are no conditions that would prevent valid audiometric testing, such as fluid in the ear, ear infection, or obstruction in an ear canal.\n                The person performing the test should also report on any other factors, such as your cooperation with the test, that can affect the interpretation of the test results.\nc. To determine whether your hearing loss meets the air and bone conduction criteria in\n2.10A\n,\n    we will average your air and bone conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hertz (Hz).\n    If you do not have a response at a particular frequency, we will use a threshold of 5 decibels (dB) over the limit of the audiometer.\nd. The SRT is the minimum dB level required for you to recognize 50 percent of the words on a standard list of spondee words. (Spondee words are two-syllable words that have equal stress on each syllable.) The SRT is usually within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. If the SRT is not within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction threshold, the reason for the discrepancy must be documented. If we cannot determine that there is a medical basis for the discrepancy, we will not use the results of the testing to determine whether your hearing loss meets a listing.\ne. Word recognition testing determines your ability to recognize a standardized list of phonetically balanced monosyllabic words in the absence of any visual cues. This testing must be performed in quiet. The list may be recorded or presented live, but in either case the words should be presented at a level of amplification that will measure your maximum ability to discriminate words, usually 35 to 40 dB above your SRT. However, the amplification level used in the testing must be medically appropriate, and you must be able to tolerate it. If you cannot be tested at 35 to 40 dB above your SRT, the person who performs the test should report your word recognition testing score at your highest comfortable level of amplification.\n3.\nWhat audiometric testing do we need when you have a cochlear implant?\na. If you have a cochlear implant, we will consider you to be disabled until 1 year after initial implantation.\nb. After that period, we need word recognition testing performed with any version of the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) to determine whether your impairment meets\n2.11B\n.\n    This testing must be conducted in quiet in a sound field.\n    Your implant must be functioning properly and adjusted to your normal settings. The sentences should be presented at 60 dB HL (Hearing Level) and without any visual cues.\n4.\nHow do we evaluate your word recognition ability if you are not fluent in English?\nIf you are not fluent in English, you should have word recognition testing using an appropriate word list for the language in which you are most fluent. \n                The person conducting the test should be fluent in the language used for the test. \n                If there is no appropriate word list or no person who is fluent in the language and qualified to perform the test, it may not be possible to measure your word recognition ability. \n                If your word recognition ability cannot be measured, your hearing loss cannot meet\n2.10B\nor\n2.11B\n.\n    Instead, we will consider the facts of your case to determine whether you have difficulty understanding words in the language in which you are most fluent, and if so,\n    whether that degree of difficulty medically equals\n2.10B\nor\n2.11B\n.\n    For example, we will consider how you interact with family members, interpreters, and other persons who speak the language in which you are most fluent.",

    "full_text": "3.00 Respiratory\n                  Disorders\nA.\nWhich disorders do we evaluate in this body  system?\nWe evaluate respiratory  disorders that result in obstruction (difficulty moving air out of the lungs) or restriction (difficulty moving air into the lungs),\n                  or that interfere with diffusion (gas exchange) across cell membranes in the lungs. Examples of such disorders and the listings we use to evaluate them include chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease\n                  (chronic bronchitis and emphysema,\n3.02\n), pulmonary fibrosis  and pneumoconiosis (\n3.02\n),\n                  asthma (\n3.02\nor\n3.03\n),\n                  cystic fibrosis (\n3.04\n), and  bronchiectasis (\n3.02\nor\n3.07\n).\n                  We also use listings in this body system to evaluate respiratory failure (\n3.04D\nor\n3.14\n),\n    chronic pulmonary hypertension (\n3.09\n), and lung transplantation (\n3.11\n).\nWe evaluate cancers affecting the respiratory system under the listings in\n13.00\n.\n    We evaluate the  pulmonary effects of neuromuscular and autoimmune disorders under these listings or under the listings in\n11.00\nor\n14.00\n, respectively.\nB.\nWhat  are the symptoms and signs of respiratory disorders?\nSymptoms and signs  of respiratory disorders include dyspnea (shortness of breath), chest pain,  coughing, wheezing, sputum production, hemoptysis (coughing up blood from the  respiratory tract), use of accessory muscles of respiration, and tachypnea  (rapid rate of breathing).\nC.\nWhat abbreviations do we use in this body system?\nABG\nmeans arterial blood  gas.\nBiPAP\nmeans bi-level  positive airway pressure ventilation.\nBTPS\nmeans body temperature and ambient  pressure, saturated with water vapor.\nCF\nmeans cystic  fibrosis.\nCFRD\nmeans CF-related  diabetes.\nCFTR\nmeans CF  transmembrane conductance regulator.\nCO\nmeans carbon  monoxide.\nCOPD\nmeans chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease.\nDLCO\nmeans diffusing  capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide.\nFEV\n1\nmeans forced  expiratory volume in the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver.\nFVC\nmeans forced vital  capacity.\nL\nmeans liter.\nmL CO (STPD)/min/mmHg\nmeans milliliters of  carbon monoxide at standard temperature and pressure, dry, per minute, per  millimeter of mercury.\nPaO\n2\nmeans arterial blood  partial pressure of oxygen.\nPaCO\n2\nmeans arterial blood partial  pressure of carbon dioxide.\nSpO\n2\nmeans percentage of  oxygen saturation of blood hemoglobin measured by pulse oximetry.\n6MWT\nmeans 6-minute walk  test.\nVI\nmeans volume of  inhaled gas during a DLCO test.\nD.\nWhat  documentation do we need to evaluate your respiratory disorder?\nWe need\nmedical evidence\nto document and assess the severity of your respiratory disorder. \n          Medical evidence should  include your medical history, physical examination findings, the results of imaging (see\n3.00D3\n),\n    pulmonary function tests (see\n3.00D4\n), other relevant laboratory tests, and descriptions of any prescribed treatment and your  response to it.\n        We may not need all of this evidence depending on your particular respiratory disorder and its effects on you.\nIf  you use\nsupplemental oxygen\n, we still  need medical evidence to establish the severity of your respiratory disorder.\nImaging\nrefers to medical imaging techniques, such as x-ray and computerized tomography. The imaging must  be consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical  practice as the proper technique to support the evaluation of the disorder.\nPulmonary function tests\ninclude\nspirometry\n(which measures ventilation of the lungs),\nDLCO\ntests (which measure gas diffusion in the lungs),\nABG\ntests (which measure the partial pressure of oxygen,\nPaO\n2\n, and carbon dioxide,\nPaCO\n2\n,  in the arterial blood), and\npulse  oximetry\n(which measures oxygen saturation,\nSpO\n2\n, of peripheral blood hemoglobin).\nE.\nWhat  is spirometry and what are our requirements for an acceptable test and report?\nSpirometry, which measures how well you move air into and out of your lungs, involves at least three forced expiratory maneuvers during the same test session. \n          A forced expiratory maneuver is a maximum inhalation followed by a forced maximum  exhalation, and measures exhaled volumes of air over time. \n          The volume of air  you exhale in the first second of the forced expiratory maneuver is the FEV\n1\n.  \n          The total volume of air that you exhale during the entire forced expiratory maneuver is the FVC. \n          We use your highest FEV\n1\nvalue to evaluate your respiratory disorder under\n3.02A\n,\n3.03A\n, and\n3.04A\n,\n    and your highest FVC value to evaluate your respiratory disorder under\n3.02B\n,\n    regardless of whether the values are from the same forced expiratory maneuver or different forced  expiratory maneuvers.\nWe have the following requirements for spirometry under these listings:\nYou must be medically stable at the time of the test. Examples of when we would not consider you to be medically stable include when you are:\nWithin 2 weeks of a change in your prescribed respiratory medication.\nExperiencing, or within 30 days of completion of treatment for, a lower respiratory tract  infection.\nExperiencing, or within 30 days of completion of treatment for, an acute exacerbation (temporary worsening) of a chronic respiratory disorder. Wheezing by itself does not indicate that you are not medically stable.\nHospitalized, or within 30 days of a hospital discharge, for an acute myocardial infarction  (heart attack).\nDuring  testing, if your FEV\n1\nis less than 70 percent of your predicted normal value,  we require repeat spirometry after inhalation of a bronchodilator to evaluate  your respiratory disorder under these listings, unless it is medically contraindicated.  If you used a bronchodilator before the test and your FEV\n1\nis less than 70  percent of your predicted normal value, we still require repeat spirometry  after inhalation of a bronchodilator unless the supervising physician  determines that it is not safe for you to take a bronchodilator again (in which  case we may need to reschedule the test). If you do not have  post-bronchodilator spirometry, the test report must explain why. We can use  the results of spirometry administered without bronchodilators when the use of  bronchodilators is medically contraindicated.\nYour  forced expiratory maneuvers must be satisfactory. We consider a forced  expiratory maneuver to be satisfactory when you exhale with maximum effort  following a full inspiration, and when the test tracing has a sharp takeoff and  rapid rise to peak flow, has a smooth contour, and either lasts for at least 6  seconds or maintains a plateau for at least 1 second.\nThe spirometry report must include the following information:\nThe  date of the test and your name, age or date of birth, gender, and height  without shoes. (We will assume that your recorded height on the date of the  test is without shoes, unless we have evidence to the contrary.) If your spine  is abnormally curved (for example, you have kyphoscoliosis), we will substitute  the longest distance between your outstretched fingertips with your arms  abducted 90 degrees in place of your height when this measurement is greater  than your standing height without shoes.\nAny  factors, if applicable, that can affect the interpretation of the test results  (for example, your cooperation or effort in doing the test).\nLegible  tracings of your forced expiratory maneuvers in a volume-time format showing  your name and the date of the test for each maneuver.\nIf  we purchase spirometry, the medical source we designate to administer the test  is solely responsible for deciding whether it is safe for you to do the test  and for how to administer it.\nF.\nWhat  is a DLCO test, and what are our requirements for an acceptable test and  report?\nA  DLCO test measures the gas exchange across cell membranes in your lungs. \n          It  measures how well CO diffuses from the alveoli (air sacs) of your lungs into  your blood. \n          DLCO may be severely reduced in some disorders, such as  interstitial lung disease (for example, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,  asbestosis, and sarcoidosis) and COPD (particularly emphysema), \n          even when the  results of spirometry are not significantly reduced. \n          We use the average of two  of your unadjusted (that is, uncorrected for hemoglobin concentration) DLCO  measurements reported in mL CO \n          (STPD)/min/mmHg to evaluate your respiratory  disorder under\n3.02C1\n.\nWe have the following requirements for DLCO tests under these listings:\nYou must be medically stable at the time of the test. See\n3.00E2a\n.\nThe test must use the single-breath technique.\nThe VI during the DLCO maneuver must be at least 85 percent of your current FVC, and your time of inhalation must be less than 4 seconds. \n                  (See\n3.00E\nfor our rules for programmatically acceptable spirometry.) If you do not have an FVC  measurement on the same day as the DLCO test, we may use your FVC from  programmatically acceptable spirometry administered within 90 days of the DLCO  test.\nYour breath-hold time must be between 8 and 12 seconds.\nYour total exhalation time must be less than or equal to 4 seconds, with a sample  collection time of less than 3 seconds. If your FVC is at least 2.0 L, the  washout volume must be between 0.75 L and 1.0 L. If your FVC is less than 2.0  L, the washout volume must be at least 0.5 L.\nThe DLCO test report must include the following information:\nThe  date of the test and your name, age or date of birth, gender, and height  without shoes. (We will assume that your recorded height on the date of the  test is without shoes, unless we have evidence to the contrary.) If your spine  is abnormally curved (for example, you have kyphoscoliosis), we will substitute  the longest distance between your outstretched fingertips with your arms  abducted 90 degrees in place of your height when this measurement is greater  than your standing height without shoes.\nAny  factors, if applicable, that can affect the interpretation of the test results  (for example, your cooperation or effort in doing the test).\nLegible  tracings of your VI, breath-hold maneuver, and volume of exhaled gas showing  your name and the date of the test for each DLCO maneuver.\nAt least two acceptable (see\n3.00F2\n) DLCO measurements within 3 mL CO (STPD)/min/mmHg of each other\nor\nwithin 10 percent of the highest value.\nWe may need to purchase a DLCO test to determine whether your disorder meets\n3.02C1\nwhen we have evidence showing that you have a chronic respiratory  disorder that could result in impaired gas exchange, unless we can make a fully  favorable determination or decision on another basis. Since the DLCO  calculation requires a current FVC measurement, we may also purchase spirometry  at the same time as the DLCO test, even if we already have programmatically  acceptable spirometry.\nBefore  we purchase a DLCO test, \n          a medical consultant (see §§\n404.1616\nand\n416.1016\nof this chapter),\n    preferably one with experience in the care of people with respiratory disorders, must review your case record to determine if we need the test.\n    The medical source we designate to administer the test is solely  responsible for deciding whether it is safe for you to do the test and for how  to administer it.\nG.\nWhat  is an ABG test, and what are our requirements for an acceptable test and  report?\nGeneral\n. An ABG test measures PaO\n2\n, PaCO\n2\n, and the concentration of hydrogen ions in your arterial blood. \n          We use a resting or an exercise ABG measurement to evaluate your  respiratory disorder under\n3.02C2\n.\nResting ABG tests\n.\nWe  have the following requirements for resting ABG tests under these listings:\nYou  must be medically stable at the time of the test. See\n3.00E2a\n.\nThe  test must be administered while you are breathing room air; that is, without  oxygen supplementation.\nThe  resting ABG test report must include the following information:\nYou name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and State of the test site.\nThe PaO\n2\nand PaCO\n2\nvalues.\nWe  may need to purchase a resting ABG test to determine whether your disorder meets\n3.02C2\nwhen we have evidence showing that you have a chronic respiratory  disorder that could result in impaired gas exchange, unless we can make a fully  favorable determination or decision on another basis.\nBefore  we purchase a resting ABG test, a medical consultant \n              (see §§\n404.1616\nand\n416.1016\nof this chapter),\n    preferably one with experience in the care of people  with respiratory disorders, must review your case record to determine if we  need the test.\n    The medical source we designate to administer the test is solely responsible for deciding whether it is safe for you to do the test and for how  to administer it.\nExercise ABG tests\n.\nWe  will not purchase an exercise ABG test.\nWe have the following requirements for exercise ABG tests under these listings:\nYou  must have done the exercise under steady state conditions while breathing room  air. If you were tested on a treadmill, you generally must have exercised for  at least 4 minutes at a grade and speed providing oxygen (O2) consumption of  approximately 17.5 milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg/min) or 5.0  metabolic equivalents (METs). If you were tested on a cycle ergometer, you generally must have exercised for at least 4 minutes at an exercise equivalent of 5.0 METs.\nWe  may use a test in which you have not exercised for at least 4 minutes. If you  were unable to complete at least 4 minutes of steady state exercise, we need a  statement by the person administering the test about whether the results are a  valid indication of your respiratory status. For example, this statement may  include information about your cooperation or effort in doing the test and whether you were limited in completing the test because of your respiratory disorder or another impairment.\nThe  exercise ABG test report must include the following information:\nYour  name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and state  of the test site.\nThe PaO\n2\nand PaCO\n2\nvalues.\nH.\nWhat is pulse oximetry, and what are our requirements for an acceptable  test and report?\nPulse oximetry measures SpO\n2\n, the percentage of oxygen saturation of blood hemoglobin. \n          We use a pulse oximetry measurement (either at rest, during a 6MWT, or after a 6MWT) to evaluate your respiratory disorder under\n3.02C3\nor, if you have CF, to evaluate it under\n3.04F\n.\n>We  have the following requirements for pulse oximetry under\n3.02C3\n:\nYou  must be medically stable at the time of the test. See\n3.00E2a\n.\nYour  pulse oximetry measurement must be recorded while you are breathing room air;  that is, without oxygen supplementation.\nYour  pulse oximetry measurement must be stable. By “stable,” we mean that the range  of SpO\n2\nvalues (that is, lowest to highest) during any 15-second interval  cannot exceed 2 percentage points. For example: (1) the measurement is stable  if the lowest SpO\n2\nvalue during a 15-second interval is 87 percent and the  highest value is 89 percent—a range of 2 percentage points. (2) The measurement  is not stable if the lowest value is 86 percent and the highest value is 89 percent—a range of 3 percentage points.\nIf  you have had more than one measurement (for example, at rest and after a 6MWT),  we will use the measurement with the lowest SpO\n2\nvalue.\nhe  pulse oximetry report must include the following information:\nYour name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and State of the test site.\nA graphical printout showing your SpO\n2\nvalue and a concurrent, acceptable pulse  wave. An acceptable pulse wave is one that shows the characteristic pulse wave; that is, sawtooth-shaped with a rapid systolic upstroke (nearly vertical)  followed by a slower diastolic downstroke (angled downward).\nWe  may need to purchase pulse oximetry at rest to determine whether your disorder meets\n3.02C3\nwhen we have evidence showing that you have a chronic respiratory disorder that could result in impaired gas exchange, unless we can make a fully favorable determination or decision on another basis. We may purchase pulse oximetry during and after a 6MWT if your SpO\n2\nvalue at rest is greater than the value in Table V.\nBefore  we purchase pulse oximetry,\n                  a medical consultant (see §§\n404.1616\nand\n416.1016\nof this chapter),\n                  preferably one with experience in the care of people with respiratory disorders,\n                  must review your case record to determine if we need the test.\n                  The medical source we designate to administer the test is solely responsible for deciding whether it is safe for you to do the test and for how to administer it.\nWe have the following requirements for pulse oximetry under\n3.04F\n:\nYou must be medically stable at the time of the test. See\n3.00E2a\n.\nYour pulse oximetry measurement must be recorded while you are breathing room air;  that is, without oxygen supplementation.\nIf you have had more than one measurement (for example, at rest and after a 6MWT), we will use the measurement with the lowest SpO\n2\nvalue.\nThe pulse oximetry report must include your name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and State of the test site. If you have CF, we do  not require a graphical printout showing your SpO\n2\nvalue and a concurrent,  acceptable pulse wave.\nI.\nWhat is asthma and how do we evaluate it?\nAsthma\nis a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lung airways that we evaluate under\n3.02\nor\n3.03\n.\n    If you have respiratory failure resulting from chronic asthma (see\n3.00N\n), we  will evaluate it under\n3.14\n.\nFor the purposes of\n3.03\n:\nWe  need evidence showing that you have listing-level (see Table VI in\n3.03A\n) airflow obstruction at baseline while you are medically stable.\nThe  phrase “consider under a disability for 1 year” in\n3.03B\ndoes not refer to the date on which your disability began, only to the date on which we must reevaluate whether your asthma continues to meet a listing or is otherwise disabling.\nWe  determine the onset of your disability based on the facts of your case, but it will be no later than the admission date of your first of three  hospitalizations that satisfy the criteria of\n3.03B\n.\nJ.\nWhat is CF and how do we evaluate it?\nGeneral\n. We evaluate CF, a genetic disorder that results in abnormal salt and water transport across cell membranes in the lungs, pancreas, and other body organs, \n          under\n3.04\n. We need the evidence described in\n3.00J2\nto establish that you have CF.\nDocumentation of CF\n. We need a report signed by a physician \n          (see §§\n404.1513(a)\nand\n416.913(a)\nof this chapter) showing both a and b:\nOne of the following:\nA positive newborn screen for CF; or\nA history of CF in a sibling; or\nDocumentation of at least one specific CF phenotype or clinical criterion (for example, chronic sino-pulmonary disease with persistent colonization or infections with typical CF pathogens, pancreatic insufficiency, or salt-loss syndromes);\nand\nOne of the following definitive laboratory tests:\nAn  elevated sweat chloride concentration equal to or greater than 60 millimoles  per L; or\nThe  identification of two CF gene mutations affecting the CFTR; or\nCharacteristic  abnormalities in ion transport across the nasal epithelium.\nWhen  we have the report showing a and b, but it is not signed by a physician, we  also need a report from a physician stating that you have CF.\nWhen  we do not have the report showing a and b, we need a report from a physician  that is persuasive that a positive diagnosis of CF was confirmed by an  appropriate definitive laboratory test. To be persuasive, this report must  include a statement by the physician that you had the appropriate definitive  laboratory test for diagnosing CF. The report must provide the test results or  explain how your diagnosis was established that is consistent with the  prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\nCF pulmonary  exacerbations\n.  Examples of CF pulmonary exacerbations include increased cough and sputum  production, hemoptysis, increased shortness of breath, increased fatigue, and  reduction in pulmonary function. Treatment usually includes intravenous  antibiotics and intensified airway clearance therapy (for example, increased  frequencies of chest percussion or increased use of inhaled nebulized  therapies, such as bronchodilators or mucolytics).\nFor\n3.04G\n, \n          we require any two exacerbations or complications from the list in\n3.04G1\nthrough\n3.04G4\nwithin a 12-month period.\n    You may have two of the same exacerbation or complication or two different ones.\nIf  you have two of the acute exacerbations or complications we describe in\n3.04G1\nand\n3.04G2\n, \n              there must be at least 30 days between the two.\nIf you have one of the acute exacerbations or complications we describe in\n3.04G1\nand\n3.04G2\nand one of the chronic complications we describe in\n3.04G3\nand\n3.04G4\n, \n              the two can occur during the same time. \n              For example, your CF meets\n3.04G\nif you have the pulmonary hemorrhage we describe in\n3.04G2\nand the weight loss we describe in\n3.04G3\neven if the pulmonary hemorrhage occurs during the 90-day period in\n3.04G3\n.\nYour  CF also meets\n3.04G\nif you have both of the chronic complications in\n3.04G3\nand\n3.04G4\n.\nCF may also affect other body systems such as digestive or endocrine. If your CF, including pulmonary exacerbations and nonpulmonary complications, does not meet or medically equal a respiratory disorders listing, we may evaluate your  CF-related impairments under the listings in the affected body system.\nK.\nWhat is bronchiectasis and how do we evaluate it?\nBronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disorder that is characterized by abnormal and irreversible  dilatation (enlargement) of the airways below the trachea, \n          which may be associated with the accumulation of mucus, bacterial infections, and eventual  airway scarring. \n          We require imaging (see\n3.00D3\n) to document this disorder.\n          We evaluate your bronchiectasis under\n3.02\n, \n          or under\n3.07\nif you are having exacerbations or complications \n          (for example, acute bacterial infections, increased shortness of breath, or coughing up blood) that require hospitalization.\nL.\nWhat is chronic pulmonary hypertension and how do we evaluate it?\nChronic pulmonary hypertension is an increase in the blood pressure of the blood vessels of the lungs. \n          If pulmonary hypertension is not adequately treated, it can eventually result in right heart failure. We evaluate chronic pulmonary hypertension due to any cause under\n3.09\n.\nChronic pulmonary hypertension is usually diagnosed by catheterization of the pulmonary artery. We will not purchase cardiac catheterization.\nM.\nHow do we evaluate lung transplantation?\nIf you receive a lung transplant (or a lung transplant simultaneously with other organs, such as the heart), \n          we will consider you to be disabled under\n3.11\nfor 3 years from the date of the transplant.\n    After that, we evaluate your residual impairment(s) by considering  the adequacy of your post-transplant function,\n    the frequency and severity of any rejection episodes you have, complications in other body systems, and adverse treatment effects.\n    People who receive organ transplants generally have  impairments that meet our definition of disability before they undergo transplantation.\n    The phrase “consider under a disability for 3 years” in\n3.11\ndoes not refer to the date on which your disability began,\n    only to the date on which we must reevaluate whether your impairment(s) continues to meet a listing or is otherwise disabling.\n    We determine the onset of your disability based on the facts of your case.\nN.\nWhat is respiratory failure and how do we evaluate it?\nRespiratory failure is the inability of the lungs to perform their basic function of gas exchange. \n          We evaluate respiratory failure under\n3.04D\nif you have CF-related respiratory failure,\n    or under\n3.14\nif you have respiratory failure due to any other chronic respiratory disorder.\n    Continuous positive airway pressure does not satisfy the criterion in\n3.04D\nor\n3.14\n,\n    and cannot be substituted as an equivalent finding, for invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP.\nO.\nHow do we consider the effects of obesity when we evaluate your  respiratory disorder?\nObesity is a medically determinable impairment that is often associated with  respiratory disorders. Obesity makes it harder for the chest and lungs to  expand, which can compromise the ability of the respiratory system to supply  adequate oxygen to the body. The combined effects of obesity with a respiratory  disorder can be greater than the effects of each of the impairments considered  separately. We consider any additional and cumulative effects of your obesity  when we determine whether you have a severe respiratory disorder, a listing-level  respiratory disorder, a combination of impairments that medically equals the  severity of a listed impairment, and when we assess your residual functional  capacity.\nP.\nWhat are sleep-related breathing disorders and how do we evaluate  them?\nSleep-related  breathing disorders\n(for example, sleep apnea) are characterized by transient episodes of  interrupted breathing during sleep, which disrupt normal sleep patterns.  Prolonged episodes can result in disorders such as hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)  and pulmonary vasoconstriction (restricted blood flow in pulmonary blood  vessels). Over time, these disorders may lead to chronic pulmonary hypertension  or other complications.\nWe evaluate the complications of sleep-related breathing disorders under the listings in the affected body system(s). \n          For example, we evaluate chronic pulmonary hypertension due to any cause under\n3.09\n;\n    chronic heart failure under\n4.02\n; \n    and disturbances in mood, cognition, and behavior under\n12.02\nor another appropriate mental disorders listing.\n    We will not purchase polysomnography (sleep study).\nQ.\nHow do we evaluate mycobacterial, mycotic, and other chronic  infections of the lungs?\nWe evaluate chronic infections of the lungs that result in limitations in your respiratory function under\n3.02\n.\nR.\nHow do we evaluate respiratory disorders that do not meet one of these listings?\nThese listings are only examples of common respiratory disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity. \n          If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider  whether you have an impairment(s) that meets the criteria of a listing in  another body system. \n          For example, if your CF has resulted in chronic pancreatic or hepatobiliary disease, we evaluate your impairment under the listings in\n5.00\n.\nIf you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n              See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.\n              Respiratory disorders may  be associated with disorders in other body systems, and we consider the combined effects of multiple impairments when we determine whether they medically equal a listing. \n              If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to  engage in substantial gainful activity. \n              We proceed to the fourth step and, if necessary, \n              the fifth step of the sequential evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter. \n              We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter, \n              as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.",

    "full_text": "4.00 Cardiovascular System\nA. General\n1.\nWhat do we mean by a cardiovascular impairment?\na. We mean any disorder that affects the proper functioning of the heart or the circulatory system (that is,  arteries, veins, capillaries, and the lymphatic drainage). The disorder can be  congenital or acquired.\nb. Cardiovascular impairment results from one or more of four consequences of heart disease:\n(i) Chronic heart failure or ventricular dysfunction.\n(ii) Discomfort or pain due to myocardial ischemia, with or without necrosis of heart muscle.\n(iii) Syncope, or near syncope, due to inadequate cerebral perfusion from any cardiac cause, such as  obstruction of flow or disturbance in rhythm or conduction resulting in  inadequate cardiac output.\n(iv) Central cyanosis due to right-to-left shunt, reduced oxygen concentration in the arterial blood, or  pulmonary vascular disease.\nc. Disorders of the veins or arteries (for example, obstruction, rupture, or aneurysm) may cause impairments of the lower extremities (peripheral vascular disease), \n                the central nervous  system, the eyes, the kidneys, and other organs. \n                We will evaluate peripheral vascular disease under\n4.11\nor\n4.12\nand impairments of another body system(s)under the listings for that body system(s).\n2.\nWhat do we consider in evaluating cardiovascular impairments?\nThe listings in this section  describe cardiovascular impairments based on symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, response to a regimen of prescribed treatment, and functional  limitations.\n3.\nWhat do the following terms or phrases mean in these listings?\na.\nMedical consultant\nis an individual defined in §§\n404.1616(a)\nand\n416.1016(a)\n. \n                This term does not include medical sources who provide consultative examinations for us. We use the abbreviation “MC” throughout this section to designate a medical consultant.\nb.\nPersistent\nmeans that the longitudinal clinical record shows that, with few exceptions, the  required finding(s) has been present, or is expected to be present, for a continuous period of at least 12 months, such that a pattern of continuing  severity is established.\nc.\nRecurrent\nmeans that the longitudinal clinical record shows that, within a consecutive 12-month  period, the finding(s) occurs at least three times, with intervening periods of  improvement of sufficient duration that it is clear that separate events are  involved.\nd.\nAppropriate medically acceptable imaging\nmeans that the technique used is the proper one to  evaluate and diagnose the impairment and is commonly recognized as accurate for  assessing the cited finding.\ne.\nA consecutive 12-month period\nmeans a period of 12 consecutive months, all or part of  which must occur within the period we are considering in connection with an  application or continuing disability review.\nf.\nUncontrolled\nmeans the impairment does not adequately respond to standard prescribed medical  treatment.\nB.\nDocumenting Cardiovascular Impairment\n1.\nWhat basic documentation do we need?\nWe need sufficiently detailed reports of  history, physical examinations, laboratory studies, and any prescribed  treatment and response to allow us to assess the severity and duration of your  cardiovascular impairment. A longitudinal clinical record covering a period of  not less than 3 months of observations and treatment is usually necessary,  unless we can make a determination or decision based on the current evidence.\n2.\nWhy is a longitudinal clinical record important?\nWe will usually need a longitudinal clinical record to assess the severity and expected duration of your impairment(s). If  you have a listing-level impairment, you probably will have received medically  prescribed treatment. Whenever there is evidence of such treatment, your  longitudinal clinical record should include a description of the ongoing  management and evaluation provided by your treating or other medical source. It  should also include your response to this medical management, as well as  information about the nature and severity of your impairment. The record will  provide us with information on your functional status over an extended period  of time and show whether your ability to function is improving, worsening, or  unchanging.\n3.\nWhat if you have not received ongoing medical treatment?\na. You may not have received ongoing treatment or have an ongoing relationship with the medical community despite the existence of a severe impairment(s). In this situation, we will  base our evaluation on the current objective medical evidence and the other  evidence we have. If you do not receive treatment, you cannot show an impairment  that meets the criteria of most of these listings. However, we may find you  disabled because you have another impairment(s) that in combination with your  cardiovascular impairment medically equals the severity of a listed impairment  or based on consideration of your residual functional capacity and age,  education, and work experience.\nb. Unless we can decide your  claim favorably on the basis of the current evidence, a longitudinal record is still important. In rare instances where there is no or insufficient  longitudinal evidence, we may purchase a consultative examination(s) to help us  establish the severity and duration of your impairment.\n4.\nWhen will we wait  before we ask for more evidence?\na. We will wait when we have  information showing that your impairment is not yet stable and the expected change in your impairment might affect our determination or decision. In these  situations, we need to wait to properly evaluate the severity and duration of  your impairment during a stable period. Examples of when we might wait are:\n(i) If you have had a recent  acute event; for example, a myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n(ii) If you have recently  had a corrective cardiac procedure; for example, coronary artery bypass grafting.\n(iii) If you have started  new drug therapy and your response to this treatment has not yet been established; for example, beta-blocker therapy for dilated congestive  cardiomyopathy.\nb. In these situations, we  will obtain more evidence 3 months following the event before we evaluate your impairment. However, we will not wait if we have enough information to make a  determination or decision based on all of the relevant evidence in your case.\n5.\nWill we purchase any  studies?\nIn appropriate situations, we will purchase studies necessary to substantiate the diagnosis or to document the severity of your impairment, \n                generally after we have evaluated the medical and other evidence we already have. \n                We will not purchase studies involving exercise testing if there is significant risk involved or if there is another medical reason not to perform the test. \n                We will follow sections\n4.00C6\n,\n4.00C7\n, and\n4.00C8\nwhen we decide whether to purchase exercise testing.\n6.\nWhat studies will we not purchase?\nWe will not purchase any studies involving cardiac  catheterization, such as coronary angiography, arteriograms, or electrophysiological studies. \n                However, if the results of catheterization are part of the existing evidence we have, we will consider them together with the  other relevant evidence. See\n4.00C15a.\nC.\nUsing Cardiovascular  Test Results\n1.\nWhat is an ECG?\na.\nECG\nstands for\nelectrocardiograph\nor\nelectrocardiogram.\nAn electrocardiograph is a machine that records  electrical impulses of your heart on a strip of paper called an electrocardiogram  or a\ntracing.\nTo record the ECG, a technician positions a number of  small contacts (or\nleads\n) on your arms, legs, and across your chest to  connect them to the ECG machine. An ECG may be done while you are resting or  exercising.\nb. The ECG tracing may  indicate that you have a heart abnormality. It may indicate that your heart  muscle is not getting as much oxygen as it needs (ischemia), that your heart  rhythm is abnormal (arrhythmia), or that there are other abnormalities of your  heart, such as left ventricular enlargement.\n2.\nHow do we evaluate  ECG evidence?\nWe consider a number of factors when we evaluate ECG  evidence:\na. An original or legible  copy of the 12-lead ECG obtained at rest must be appropriately dated and  labeled, with the standardization inscribed on the tracing. Alteration in  standardization of specific leads (such as to accommodate large QRS amplitudes)  must be identified on those leads.\n(i) Detailed descriptions or computer-averaged signals without original or legible copies of the ECG as described in listing\n4.00C2a\nare not acceptable.\n(ii) The effects of drugs or  electrolyte abnormalities must be considered as possible noncardiac causes of  ECG abnormalities of ventricular repolarization; that is, those involving the  ST segment and T wave. If available, the predrug (especially digitalis  glycosides) ECG should be submitted.\nb. ECGs obtained in  conjunction with treadmill, bicycle, or arm exercise tests should meet the  following specifications:\n(i) ECG reports must include  the original calibrated ECG tracings or a legible copy.\n(ii) A 12-lead baseline ECG  must be recorded in the upright position before exercise.\niii) A 12-lead ECG should  be recorded at the end of each minute of exercise.\n(iv) If ECG documentation of  the effects of hyperventilation is obtained, the exercise test should be  deferred for at least 10 minutes because metabolic changes of hyperventilation  may alter the physiologic and ECG-recorded response to exercise.\n(v) Post-exercise ECGs  should be recorded using a generally accepted protocol consistent with the  prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\n(vi) All resting, exercise,  and recovery ECG strips must have the standardization inscribed on the tracing.  The ECG strips should be labeled to indicate the date, the times recorded and  the relationship to the stage of the exercise protocol. The speed and grade  (treadmill test) or work rate (bicycle or arm ergometric test) should be  recorded. The highest level of exercise achieved, heart rate and blood pressure  levels during testing, and the reason(s) for terminating the test (including  limiting signs or symptoms) must be recorded.\n3.\nWhat are exercise tests and what are they used for?\na. Exercise tests have you perform physical activity and record how your cardiovascular system responds.  Exercise tests usually involve walking on a treadmill, but other forms of  exercise, such as an exercise bicycle or an arm exercise machine, may be used.  Exercise testing may be done for various reasons; such as to evaluate the  severity of your coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease or to  evaluate your progress after a cardiac procedure or an acute event, like a  myocardial infarction (heart attack). Exercise testing is the most widely used  testing for identifying the presence of myocardial ischemia and for estimating  maximal aerobic capacity (usually expressed in METs—metabolic equivalents) if  you have heart disease.\nb. We include exercise tolerance test (ETT) criteria in\n4.02B3\n(chronic heart failure) and\n4.04A\n(ischemic heart disease).\n    To meet the ETT criteria in these listings, the ETT must be a sign-or symptom-limited test in which you exercise while connected to an ECG until you develop a sign or symptom that indicates that you have\n    exercised as much as is considered safe for you.\nc. In\n4.12B\n, we also refer to exercise testing for peripheral vascular disease. \n                In this test, you walk on a treadmill, usually for a specified period of time, and the individual who administers the test measures the effect of exercise on the flow of blood in your legs, usually by using ultrasound. \n                The test is also called an exercise Doppler test. Even though this test is intended to evaluate peripheral vascular disease, \n                it will be stopped for your safety if you develop abnormal signs or symptoms because of heart disease.\nd. Each type of test is done in a certain way following specific criteria, called a\nprotocol.\nFor our program, we also specify certain aspects of how any exercise test we  purchase is to be done. See\n4.00C10\nand\n4.00C17\n.\n4.\nDo ETTs have  limitations?\nAn ETT provides an estimate of aerobic capacity for walking  on a grade, bicycling, or moving one's arms in an environmentally controlled  setting. Therefore, ETT results do not correlate with the ability to perform  other types of exertional activities, such as lifting and carrying heavy loads,  and do not provide an estimate of the ability to perform activities required  for work in all possible work environments or throughout a workday. Also,  certain medications (such as beta blockers) and conduction disorders (such as  left or right bundle branch blocks) can cause false-negative or false-positive  results. Therefore, we must consider the results of an ETT together with all  the other relevant evidence in your case record.\n5.\nHow does an ETT with  measurement of maximal or peak oxygen uptake (VO\n2\n) differ  from other ETTs?\nOccasionally, medical evidence will include the results  of an ETT with VO2. While ETTs without measurement of VO2  provide only an estimate of aerobic capacity, measured maximal or peak oxygen  uptake provides an accurate measurement of aerobic capacity, which is often  expressed in METs (metabolic equivalents). The MET level may not be indicated  in the report of attained maximal or peak VO2 testing, but can be  calculated as follows: 1 MET = 3.5 milliliters (ml) of oxygen uptake per  kilogram (kg) of body weight per minute. For example, a 70 kg (154 lb.)  individual who achieves a maximal or peak VO2 of 1225 ml in 1 minute  has attained 5 METs (1225 ml/70 kg/1 min = 17.5 ml/kg/min. 17.5/3.5 = 5 METs).\n6.\nWhen will we consider  whether to purchase an exercise test?\na. We will consider whether  to purchase an exercise test when:\n(i) There is a question whether your cardiovascular impairment meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listings, \n                or there is no timely test in the evidence we have (see\n4.00C9\n), and we cannot find you disabled on some other basis; or\n(ii) We need to assess your  residual functional capacity and there is insufficient evidence in the record  to make a determination or decision.\nb. We will not purchase an  exercise test when we can make our determination or decision based on the  evidence we already have.\n7.\nWhat must we do  before purchasing an exercise test?\na. Before we purchase an exercise test, an MC, preferably one with experience in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease, \n                must review the pertinent history, physical  examinations, and laboratory tests that we have to determine whether the test would present a significant risk to you or if there is some other medical \n                reason not to purchase the test (see\n4.00C8\n).\nb. If you are under the care  of a treating source \n                (see §§\n404.1502\nand\n416.902\n) for a cardiovascular impairment, \n                this source has not performed an exercise test, and there are no reported significant risks to testing, \n                we will request a statement from that source explaining why it was not done or should not be done before we decide whether we will purchase the test.\nc. The MC, in accordance  with the regulations and other instructions on consultative examinations, will  generally give great weight to the treating source's opinion about the risk of  exercise testing to you and will generally not override it. In the rare  situation in which the MC does override the treating source's opinion, the MC  must prepare a written rationale documenting the reasons for overriding the  opinion.\nd. If you do not have a  treating source or we cannot obtain a statement from your treating source, the  MC is responsible for assessing the risk to exercise testing based on a review  of the records we have before purchasing an exercise test for you.\ne. We must also provide your  records to the medical source who performs the exercise test for review prior  to conducting the test if the source does not already have them. The medical  source who performs the exercise test has the ultimate responsibility for  deciding whether you would be at risk.\n8.\nWhen will we not  purchase an exercise test or wait before we purchase an exercise test?\na. We will not purchase an  exercise test when an MC finds that you have one of the following significant  risk factors:\n(i) Unstable angina not  previously stabilized by medical treatment.\n(ii) Uncontrolled cardiac  arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise.\n(iii) An implanted cardiac  defibrillator.\n(iv) Symptomatic severe  aortic stenosis.\n(v) Uncontrolled symptomatic  heart failure.\n(vi) Aortic dissection.\n(vii) Severe pulmonary  hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 60 mm Hg).\n(viii) Left main coronary  stenosis of 50 percent or greater that has not been bypassed.\n(ix) Moderate stenotic  valvular disease with a systolic gradient across the aortic valve of 50 mm Hg  or greater.\n(x) Severe arterial  hypertension (systolic greater than 200 mm Hg or diastolic greater than 110 mm  Hg).\n(xi) Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy with a systolic gradient of 50 mm Hg or greater.\nb. We also will not purchase  an exercise test when you are prevented from performing exercise testing due to  another impairment affecting your ability to use your arms and legs.\nc. We will not purchase an  ETT to document the presence of a cardiac arrhythmia.\nd. We will wait to purchase  an exercise test until 3 months after you have had one of the following events.  This will allow for maximal, attainable restoration of functional capacity.\n(i) Acute myocardial  infarction.\n(ii) Surgical myocardial  revascularization (bypass surgery).\n(iii) Other open-heart  surgical procedures.\n(iv) Percutaneous  transluminal coronary angioplasty with or without stenting.\ne. If you are deconditioned  after an extended period of bedrest or inactivity and could improve with  activity, or if you are in acute heart failure and are expected to improve with  treatment, we will wait an appropriate period of time for you to recuperate  before we purchase an exercise test.\n9.\nWhat do we mean by a  “timely” test?\na. We consider exercise test  results to be timely for 12 months after the date they are performed, provided  there has been no change in your clinical status that may alter the severity of  your cardiovascular impairment.\nb. However, an exercise test  that is older than 12 months, especially an abnormal one, can still provide  information important to our adjudication. For example, a test that is more  than 12 months old can provide evidence of ischemic heart disease or peripheral  vascular disease, information on decreased aerobic capacity, or information  about the duration or onset of your impairment. Such tests can be an important  component of the longitudinal record.\nc. When we evaluate a test  that is more than 12 months old, we must consider the results in the context of  all the relevant evidence, including why the test was performed and whether  there has been an intervening event or improvement or worsening of your  impairment.\nd. We will purchase a new  exercise test only if we cannot make a determination or decision based on the  evidence we have.\n10.\nHow must ETTs we  purchase be performed?\na. The ETT must be a sign- or symptom-limited test characterized by a progressive multistage regimen. \n                It must be performed using a generally accepted protocol consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice. \n                A description of  the protocol that was followed must be provided, and the test must meet the requirements of\n4.00C2b\nand this section.\n    A radionuclide perfusion scan may be  useful for detecting or confirming ischemia when resting ECG abnormalities, medications, or other factors may decrease the accuracy of ECG interpretation of ischemia.\n    (The perfusion imaging is done at the termination of exercise, which may be at a higher MET level than that at which ischemia first occurs.\n    If the imaging confirms the presence of reversible ischemia, the exercise ECG may be useful for detecting the MET level at which ischemia initially appeared.)\n    Exercise tests may also be performed using echocardiography to detect stress-induced ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction (see\n4.00C12\nand\n4.00C13\n).\nb. The exercise test must be  paced to your capabilities and be performed following the generally accepted  standards for adult exercise test laboratories. With a treadmill test, the  speed, grade (incline), and duration of exercise must be recorded for each  exercise test stage performed. Other exercise test protocols or techniques  should use similar workloads. The exercise protocol may need to be modified in  individual cases to allow for a lower initial workload with more slowly graded  increments than the standard Bruce protocol.\nc. Levels of exercise must  be described in terms of workload and duration of each stage; for example,  treadmill speed and grade, or bicycle ergometer work rate in kpm/min or watts.\nd. The exercise laboratory's  physical environment, staffing, and equipment must meet the generally accepted  standards for adult exercise test laboratories.\n11.\nHow do we evaluate  ETT results?\nWe evaluate ETT results on the basis of the work level at  which the test becomes abnormal, as documented by onset of signs or symptoms  and any ECG or imaging abnormalities. The absence of an ischemic response on an  ETT alone does not exclude the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. We must  consider the results of an ETT in the context of all of the other evidence in  your case record.\n12.\nWhen are ETTs done with  imaging?\nWhen resting ECG abnormalities preclude interpretation of ETT  tracings relative to ischemia, a radionuclide (for example, thallium-201 or  technetium-99m) perfusion scan or echocardiography in conjunction with an ETT  provides better results. You may have resting ECG abnormalities when you have a  conduction defect—for example, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, left bundle  branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy—or when you are taking digitalis or  other antiarrhythmic drugs, or when resting ST changes are present. Also, these  techniques can provide a reliable estimate of ejection fraction.\n13.\nWill we purchase ETTs with imaging?\nWe may purchase an ETT with imaging in your case after an MC, preferably one with experience in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease, \n                has reviewed your medical history and physical examination, any report(s) of appropriate medically acceptable imaging, ECGs, and other appropriate tests. \n                We will consider purchasing an ETT with imaging when other information we have is not adequate for us to assess whether you have severe ventricular dysfunction or myocardial ischemia, \n                there is no significant risk involved (see\n4.00C8a\n), and we cannot make our determination or decision based on the evidence we already have.\n14.\nWhat are drug-induced stress tests?\nThese tests are designed primarily to provide  evidence about myocardial ischemia or prior myocardial infarction, but do not  require you to exercise. These tests are used when you cannot exercise or  cannot exercise enough to achieve the desired cardiac stress. Drug-induced  stress tests can also provide evidence about heart chamber dimensions and  function; however, these tests do not provide information about your aerobic  capacity and cannot be used to help us assess your ability to function. Some of  these tests use agents, such as Persantine or adenosine, that dilate the  coronary arteries and are used in combination with nuclear agents, such as  thallium or technetium (for example, Cardiolyte or Myoview), and a myocardial scan.  Other tests use agents, such as dobutamine, that stimulate the heart to  contract more forcefully and faster to simulate exercise and are used in  combination with a 2-dimensional echocardiogram. We may, when appropriate,  purchase a drug-induced stress test to confirm the presence of myocardial  ischemia after a review of the evidence in your file by an MC, preferably one  with experience in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.\n15.\nHow do we evaluate  cardiac catheterization evidence?\na. We will not purchase  cardiac catheterization; however, if you have had catheterization, we will make  every reasonable effort to obtain the report and any ancillary studies. We will  consider the quality and type of data provided and its relevance to the evaluation  of your impairment. For adults, we generally see two types of catheterization  reports: Coronary arteriography and left ventriculography.\nb. For coronary  arteriography, the report should provide information citing the method of  assessing coronary arterial lumen diameter and the nature and location of  obstructive lesions. Drug treatment at baseline and during the procedure should  be reported. Some individuals with significant coronary atherosclerotic  obstruction have collateral vessels that supply the myocardium distal to the  arterial obstruction so that there is no evidence of myocardial damage or  ischemia, even with exercise. When the results of quantitative computer  measurements and analyses are included in your case record, we will consider  them in interpreting the severity of stenotic lesions.\nc. For left  ventriculography, the report should describe the wall motion of the myocardium  with regard to any areas of hypokinesis (abnormally decreased motion), akinesis  (lack of motion), or dyskinesis (distortion of motion), and the overall  contraction of the ventricle as measured by the ejection fraction. Measurement  of chamber volumes and pressures may be useful. Quantitative computer analysis  provides precise measurement of segmental left ventricular wall thickness and  motion. There is often a poor correlation between left ventricular function at  rest and functional capacity for physical activity.\n16.\nWhat details should  exercise Doppler test reports contain?\nThe reports of exercise Doppler  tests must describe the level of exercise; for example, the speed and grade of  the treadmill settings, the duration of exercise, symptoms during exercise, and  the reasons for stopping exercise if the expected level of exercise was not  attained. They must also include the blood pressures at the ankle and other  pertinent sites measured after exercise and the time required for the systolic  blood pressure to return toward or to the pre-exercise level. The graphic  tracings, if available, should also be included with the report. All tracings  must be annotated with the standardization used by the testing facility.\n17.\nHow must exercise Doppler tests we purchase be performed?\nWhen we purchase an exercise Doppler test, you must exercise on a treadmill at 2 mph on a 12 percent grade for up to 5 minutes. \n                The reports must include the information specified in\n4.00C16\n.\n    Because this is an exercise test, we must evaluate whether such testing would put you at significant risk,\n    in accordance with the guidance found in\n4.00C6\n,\n4.00C7\n, and\n4.00C8\n.\nD.\nEvaluating  Chronic Heart Failure\n1.\nWhat is chronic heart  failure (CHF)?\na.\nCHF\nis the  inability of the heart to pump enough oxygenated blood to body tissues. This  syndrome is characterized by symptoms and signs of pulmonary or systemic  congestion (fluid retention) or limited cardiac output. Certain laboratory  findings of cardiac functional and structural abnormality support the diagnosis  of CHF. There are two main types of CHF:\n(i)\nPredominant systolic  dysfunction\n(the inability of the heart to contract normally and expel  sufficient blood), which is characterized by a dilated, poorly contracting left  ventricle and reduced ejection fraction (abbreviated EF, it represents the  percentage of the blood in the ventricle actually pumped out with each contraction),  and\n(ii)\nPredominant  diastolic dysfunction\n(the inability of the heart to relax and fill  normally), which is characterized by a thickened ventricular muscle, poor  ability of the left ventricle to distend, increased ventricular filling pressure,  and a normal or increased EF.\nb. CHF is considered in  these listings as a single category whether due to atherosclerosis (narrowing  of the arteries), \n                cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or rheumatic, congenital, or  other heart disease. \n                However, if the CHF is the result of primary pulmonary hypertension secondary to disease of the lung (cor pulmonale), \n                we will evaluate your impairment using\n3.09\n, in the respiratory system listings.\n2.\nWhat evidence of CHF  do we need?\na. Cardiomegaly or ventricular dysfunction must be present and demonstrated by appropriate  medically acceptable imaging, such as chest x-ray, echocardiography (M-Mode,  2-dimensional, and Doppler), radionuclide studies, or cardiac catheterization.\n(i) Abnormal cardiac imaging showing increased left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), decreased  EF, increased left atrial chamber size, increased ventricular filling pressures  measured at cardiac catheterization, or increased left ventricular wall or  septum thickness, provides objective measures of both left ventricular function  and structural abnormality in heart failure.\n(ii) An LVEDD greater than 6.0 cm or an EF of 30 percent or less measured during a period of stability  (that is, not during an episode of acute heart failure) may be associated  clinically with systolic failure.\n(iii) Left ventricular posterior wall thickness added to septal thickness totaling 2.5 cm or greater  with left atrium enlarged to 4.5 cm or greater may be associated clinically  with diastolic failure.\n(iv) However, these measurements alone do not reflect your functional capacity, which we evaluate  by considering all of the relevant evidence. In some situations, we may need to  purchase an ETT to help us assess your functional capacity.\n(v) Other findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging may include increased pulmonary  vascular markings, pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema. These findings need  not be present on each report, since CHF may be controlled by prescribed  treatment.\nb. To establish that you have\nchronic\nheart failure, your medical history and physical  examination should describe characteristic symptoms and signs of pulmonary or  systemic congestion or of limited cardiac output associated with the abnormal  findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging. When an acute episode of  heart failure is triggered by a remediable factor, such as an arrhythmia,  dietary sodium overload, or high altitude, cardiac function may be restored and  a chronic impairment may not be present.\n(i) Symptoms of congestion  or of limited cardiac output include easy fatigue, weakness, shortness of  breath (dyspnea), cough, or chest discomfort at rest or with activity.  Individuals with CHF may also experience shortness of breath on lying flat  (orthopnea) or episodes of shortness of breath that wake them from sleep  (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). They may also experience cardiac arrhythmias  resulting in palpitations, lightheadedness, or fainting.\n(ii) Signs of congestion may include hepatomegaly, ascites, increased jugular venous distention or pressure,  rales, peripheral edema, or rapid weight gain. However, these signs need not be  found on all examinations because fluid retention may be controlled by  prescribed treatment.\n3.\nIs it safe for you to  have an ETT, if you have CHF?\nThe presence of CHF is not necessarily a contraindication to an ETT, unless you are having an acute episode of heart failure.\n                Measures of cardiac performance are valuable in helping us evaluate  your ability to do work-related activities.\n                Exercise testing has been safely  used in individuals with CHF; therefore, we may purchase an ETT for evaluation under\n4.02B3\nif an MC,\n                preferably one experienced in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease, determines that there is no significant risk to you.\n                (See\n4.00C6\nfor when we will consider the purchase of an ETT. See\n4.00C7\n-\n4.00C8\nfor what we must do before we purchase an ETT and when we will not purchase one.)\n        ST segment changes from digitalis use in the treatment of CHF do not preclude  the purchase of an ETT.\n4.\nHow do we evaluate CHF using\n4.02\n?\na. We must have objective  evidence, as described in\n4.00D2\n, that you have chronic heart failure.\nb. To meet the required  level of severity for this listing, your impairment must satisfy the  requirements of one of the criteria in A and one of the criteria in B.\nc. In\n4.02B2\n, the phrase\nperiods of stabilization\nmeans that, for at least 2 weeks between episodes of  acute heart failure, there must be objective evidence of clearing of the  pulmonary edema or pleural effusions and evidence that you returned to, or you  were medically considered able to return to, your prior level of activity.\nd. Listing\n4.02B3c\nrequires  a decrease in systolic blood pressure below the baseline level (taken in the  standing position immediately prior to exercise) or below any systolic pressure  reading recorded during exercise. This is because, normally, systolic blood  pressure and heart rate increase gradually with exercise. Decreases in systolic  blood pressure below the baseline level that occur during exercise are often  associated with ischemia-induced left ventricular dysfunction resulting in  decreased cardiac output. However, a blunted response (that is, failure of the  systolic blood pressure to rise 10 mm Hg or more), particularly in the first 3  minutes of exercise, may be drug-related and is not necessarily associated with  left ventricular dysfunction. Also, some individuals with increased sympathetic  responses because of deconditioning or apprehension may increase their systolic  blood pressure and heart rate above their baseline level just before and early  into exercise. This can be associated with a drop in systolic pressure in early  exercise that is not due to left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, an early  decrease in systolic blood pressure must be interpreted within the total  context of the test; that is, the presence or absence of symptoms such as  lightheadedness, ischemic changes, or arrhythmias on the ECG.\nE.\nEvaluating  Ischemic Heart Disease\n1.\nWhat is ischemic  heart disease (IHD)? IHD\nresults when one or more of your coronary  arteries is narrowed or obstructed or, in rare situations, constricted due to  vasospasm, interfering with the normal flow of blood to your heart muscle  (ischemia). The obstruction may be the result of an embolus, a thrombus, or  plaque. When heart muscle tissue dies as a result of the reduced blood supply,  it is called a myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n2.\nWhat causes chest  discomfort of myocardial origin?\na. Chest discomfort of  myocardial ischemic origin, commonly known as angina pectoris, is usually  caused by coronary artery disease (often abbreviated CAD). However, ischemic  discomfort may be caused by a noncoronary artery impairment, such as aortic  stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or anemia.\nb. Instead of typical angina  pectoris, some individuals with IHD experience atypical angina, anginal  equivalent, variant angina, or silent ischemia,\n                all of which we may evaluate using\n4.04\n.\n                We discuss the various manifestations of ischemia in\n4.00E3\n-\n4.00E7\n.\n3.\nWhat are the  characteristics of typical angina pectoris?\nDiscomfort of myocardial  ischemic origin (angina pectoris) is discomfort that is precipitated by effort  or emotion and promptly relieved by rest, sublingual nitroglycerin (that is,  nitroglycerin tablets that are placed under the tongue), or other rapidly  acting nitrates. Typically, the discomfort is located in the chest (usually  substernal) and described as pressing, crushing, squeezing, burning, aching, or  oppressive. Sharp, sticking, or cramping discomfort is less common. Discomfort  occurring with activity or emotion should be described specifically as to  timing and usual inciting factors (type and intensity), character, location,  radiation, duration, and response to nitrate treatment or rest.\n4.\nWhat is atypical  angina? Atypical angina\ndescribes discomfort or pain from myocardial  ischemia that is felt in places other than the chest. The common sites of  cardiac pain are the inner aspect of the left arm, neck, jaw(s), upper abdomen,  and back, but the discomfort or pain can be elsewhere. When pain of cardiac  ischemic origin presents in an atypical site in the absence of chest  discomfort, the source of the pain may be difficult to diagnose. To represent  atypical angina, your discomfort or pain should have precipitating and  relieving factors similar to those of typical chest discomfort, and we must  have objective medical evidence of myocardial ischemia; for example, ECG or ETT  evidence or appropriate medically acceptable imaging.\n5.\nWhat is anginal equivalent?\nOften, individuals with IHD will complain of shortness of  breath (dyspnea) on exertion without chest pain or discomfort. In a minority of  such situations, the shortness of breath is due to myocardial ischemia; this is  called\nanginal equivalent\n. To represent anginal equivalent, your  shortness of breath should have precipitating and relieving factors similar to  those of typical chest discomfort, and we must have objective medical evidence  of myocardial ischemia; for example, ECG or ETT evidence or appropriate  medically acceptable imaging. In these situations, it is essential to establish  objective evidence of myocardial ischemia to ensure that you do not have effort  dyspnea due to non-ischemic or non-cardiac causes.\n6.\nWhat is variant angina?\na.\nVariant angina\n(Prinzmetal's angina, vasospastic angina) refers to the occurrence of anginal episodes at rest, especially at night,\n                accompanied by transitory ST segment elevation (or, at times, ST depression) on an ECG.\n                It is due to severe spasm of  a coronary artery, causing ischemia of the heart wall, and is often accompanied by major ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia.\n                We will consider variant angina under\n4.04\nonly if you have spasm of a coronary artery in relation to an obstructive lesion of the vessel.\n                If you have an arrhythmia as a result of variant angina, we may consider your impairment under\n4.05\n.\nb. Variant angina may also  occur in the absence of obstructive coronary disease. In this situation, an ETT  will not demonstrate ischemia. The diagnosis will be established by showing the  typical transitory ST segment changes during attacks of pain, and the absence  of obstructive lesions shown by catheterization. Treatment in cases where there  is no obstructive coronary disease is limited to medications that reduce  coronary vasospasm, such as calcium channel blockers and nitrates. In such  situations, we will consider the frequency of anginal episodes despite  prescribed treatment when evaluating your residual functional capacity.\nc. Vasospasm that is  catheter-induced during coronary angiography is not variant angina.\n7.\nWhat is silent  ischemia?\na. Myocardial ischemia, and  even myocardial infarction, can occur without perception of pain or any other  symptoms; when this happens, we call it\nsilent ischemia\n. Pain  sensitivity may be altered by a variety of diseases, most notably diabetes  mellitus and other neuropathic disorders. Individuals also vary in their  threshold for pain.\nb. Silent ischemia occurs  most often in:\n(i) Individuals with  documented past myocardial infarction or established angina without prior  infarction who do not have chest pain on ETT, but have a positive test with  ischemic abnormality on ECG, perfusion scan, or other appropriate medically  acceptable imaging.\n(ii) Individuals with  documented past myocardial infarction or angina who have ST segment changes on  ambulatory monitoring (Holter monitoring) that are similar to those that occur  during episodes of angina. ST depression shown on the ambulatory recording  should not be interpreted as positive for ischemia unless similar depression is  also seen during chest pain episodes annotated in the diary that the individual  keeps while wearing the Holter monitor.\nc. ST depression can result from a variety of factors, such as postural changes and variations in cardiac sympathetic tone.\n                In addition, there are differences in how different Holter monitors record the electrical responses.\n                Therefore, we do not consider the  Holter monitor reliable for the diagnosis of silent ischemia except in the  situation described in\n4.00E7b(ii)\n.\n8.\nWhat other sources of  chest discomfort are there?\nChest discomfort of nonischemic origin may  result from other cardiac impairments, such as pericarditis. Noncardiac impairments  may also produce symptoms mimicking that of myocardial ischemia. These  impairments include acute anxiety or panic attacks, gastrointestinal tract  disorders, such as esophageal spasm, esophagitis, hiatal hernia, biliary tract  disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer, and pancreatitis, and musculoskeletal  syndromes, such as chest wall muscle spasm, chest wall syndrome (especially  after coronary bypass surgery), costochondritis, and cervical or dorsal spine  arthritis. Hyperventilation may also mimic ischemic discomfort. Thus, in the  absence of documented myocardial ischemia, such disorders should be considered  as possible causes of chest discomfort.\n9.\nHow do we evaluate IHD using\n4.04\n?\na. We must have objective evidence, as described under\n4.00C\n, that your symptoms are due to myocardial ischemia.\nb. Listing-level changes on  the ECG in\n4.04A1\nare the classically accepted changes of horizontal or\n                downsloping ST depression occurring both during exercise and recovery.\n                Although we recognize that ischemic changes may at times occur only during exercise or  recovery, and may at times be upsloping with only junctional ST depression, such changes can be false positive; that is,\n                occur in the absence of ischemia.  Diagnosis of ischemia in this situation requires radionuclide or echocardiogram confirmation.\n                See\n4.00C12\nand\n4.00C13\n.\nc. Also in\n4.04A1\n, \n                we require that the depression of the ST segment last for at least 1 minute of recovery because ST depression that occurs during exercise but that rapidly normalizes in recovery is a common false-positive response.\nd. In\n4.04A2\n, we specify that the ST elevation must be in non-infarct leads during both exercise and recovery.\n                This is because, in the absence of ECG signs of prior infarction, ST elevation during exercise denotes ischemia, usually severe, requiring immediate termination of exercise.\n                However, if there is baseline ST elevation in association with a prior infarction or ventricular aneurysm,\n                further ST elevation during exercise does not necessarily denote ischemia and could be a false-positive ECG response.\n                Diagnosis of ischemia in this situation requires  radionuclide or echocardiogram confirmation. See\n4.00C12\nand\n4.00C13\n.\ne. Listing\n4.04A3\nrequires a decrease in systolic blood pressure below the baseline level\n                (taken in the standing position immediately prior to exercise) or below any systolic pressure reading recorded during exercise.\n                This is the same finding required in\n4.02B3c\n.  See\n4.00D4d\nfor full details.\nf. In\n4.04B\n, each of the three ischemic episodes must require revascularization or be not amenable to treatment.\nRevascularization\nmeans angioplasty (with or without stent  placement) or bypass surgery. \n                However, reocclusion that occurs after a revascularization procedure but during the same hospitalization and that requires a second procedure during the same hospitalization will not be counted as another ischemic episode. Not amenable means that the revascularization  procedure could not be done because of another medical impairment or because  the vessel was not suitable for revascularization.\ng. We will use\n4.04C\nonly when you have symptoms due to myocardial ischemia as described in\n4.00E3\n-\n4.00E7\nwhile on a regimen of prescribed treatment, \n                you are at risk for exercise testing (see\n4.00C8\n), and we do not have a timely ETT or a timely normal drug-induced stress test for you. \n                See\n4.00C9\nfor what we mean by a timely test.\nh. In\n4.04C1\nthe term\nnonbypassed\nmeans that the blockage is in a vessel that is potentially bypassable; \n                that is, large enough to be bypassed and considered to be a cause of your ischemia.  \n                These vessels are usually major arteries or one of a major artery's major  branches. \n                A vessel that has become obstructed again after angioplasty or stent placement and has remained obstructed or is not amenable to another revascularization is considered a nonbypassed vessel for purposes of this listing. \n                When you have had revascularization, we will not use the pre-operative findings to assess the current severity of your coronary artery disease under\n4.04C\n,\n    although we will consider the severity and duration of your impairment  prior to your surgery in making our determination or decision.\nF.\nEvaluating  Arrhythmias\n1.\nWhat is an  arrhythmia?\nAn\narrhythmia\nis a change in the regular beat of the  heart. Your heart may seem to skip a beat or beat irregularly, very quickly  (tachycardia), or very slowly (bradycardia).\n2.\nWhat are the  different types of arrhythmias?\na. There are many types of  arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are identified by where they occur in the heart (atria  or ventricles) and by what happens to the heart's rhythm when they occur.\nb. Arrhythmias arising in  the cardiac atria (upper chambers of the heart) are called atrial or  supraventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias begin in the ventricles  (lower chambers). In general, ventricular arrhythmias caused by heart disease  are the most serious.\n3.\nHow do we evaluate  arrhythmias using\n4.05\n?\na. We will use\n4.05\nwhen you  have arrhythmias that are not fully controlled by medication, an implanted  pacemaker, \n                or an implanted cardiac defibrillator and you have uncontrolled  recurrent episodes of syncope or near syncope.\n                If your arrhythmias are controlled, we will evaluate your underlying heart disease using the  appropriate listing. \n                For other considerations when we evaluate arrhythmias in the presence of an implanted cardiac defibrillator, see\n4.00F4\n.\nb. We consider\nnear  syncope\nto be a period of altered consciousness, since syncope is a loss of consciousness or a faint. It is not merely a feeling of light-headedness,  momentary weakness, or dizziness.\nc. For purposes of\n4.05\n, there must be a documented association between the syncope or near syncope and  the recurrent arrhythmia. The recurrent arrhythmia, not some other cardiac or  non-cardiac disorder, must be established as the cause of the associated  symptom. This documentation of the association between the symptoms and the  arrhythmia may come from the usual diagnostic methods, including Holter  monitoring (also called ambulatory electrocardiography) and tilt-table testing  with a concurrent ECG. Although an arrhythmia may be a coincidental finding on  an ETT, we will not purchase an ETT to document the presence of a cardiac  arrhythmia.\n4.\nWhat will we consider  when you have an implanted cardiac defibrillator and you do not have  arrhythmias that meet the requirements of\n4.05\n?\na. Implanted cardiac  defibrillators are used to prevent sudden cardiac death in individuals who have  had, or are at high risk for, \n                cardiac arrest from life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The largest group at risk for sudden cardiac death consists of individuals with cardiomyopathy (ischemic or non-ischemic) and reduced ventricular function. \n                However, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias can also occur in individuals with little or no ventricular dysfunction. \n                The shock from the implanted cardiac defibrillator is a unique form of treatment; it rescues an individual from what may have been cardiac arrest. \n                However, as a consequence of the shock(s), individuals may experience psychological distress, which we may evaluate under the mental disorders listings in\n12.00ff\n.\nb. Most implantable cardiac  defibrillators have rhythm-correcting and pacemaker capabilities. In some  individuals, these functions may result in the termination of ventricular arrhythmias  without an otherwise painful shock. (The shock is like being kicked in the  chest.) Implanted cardiac defibrillators may deliver inappropriate shocks,  often repeatedly, in response to benign arrhythmias or electrical malfunction.  Also, exposure to strong electrical or magnetic fields, such as from MRI  (magnetic resonance imaging), can trigger or reprogram an implanted cardiac  defibrillator, resulting in inappropriate shocks. We must consider the  frequency of, and the reason(s) for, the shocks when evaluating the severity  and duration of your impairment.\nc. In general, the exercise  limitations imposed on individuals with an implanted cardiac defibrillator are  those dictated by the underlying heart impairment. However, the exercise  limitations may be greater when the implanted cardiac defibrillator delivers an  inappropriate shock in response to the increase in heart rate with exercise, or  when there is exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmia.\nG.\nEvaluating  Peripheral Vascular Disease\n1.\nWhat is peripheral  vascular disease (PVD)?\nGenerally,\nPVD\nis any impairment that  affects either the arteries (peripheral arterial disease) or the veins (venous  insufficiency) in the extremities, particularly the lower extremities. The  usual effect is blockage of the flow of blood either from the heart (arterial)  or back to the heart (venous). If you have peripheral arterial disease, you may  have pain in your calf after walking a distance that goes away when you rest  (intermittent claudication); at more advanced stages, you may have pain in your  calf at rest or you may develop ulceration or gangrene. If you have venous  insufficiency, you may have swelling, varicose veins, skin pigmentation  changes, or skin ulceration.\n2.\nHow do we assess  limitations resulting from PVD?\nWe will assess your limitations based on  your symptoms together with physical findings, Doppler studies, other  appropriate non-invasive studies, or angiographic findings. \n                However, if the PVD  has resulted in amputation, we will evaluate any limitations related to the  amputation under the musculoskeletal listings,\n1.00ff\n.\n3.\nWhat is brawny edema? Brawny edema\n(\n4.11A\n) \n                is swelling that is usually dense and feels firm due to the presence of increased connective tissue; it is also associated with  characteristic skin pigmentation changes. \n                It is not the same thing as pitting edema. Brawny edema generally does not pit (indent on pressure), and the terms  are not interchangeable. \n                Pitting edema does not satisfy the requirements of\n4.11A\n.\n4.\nWhat is lymphedema and how will we evaluate it?\na.\nLymphedema\nis edema of the extremities due to a disorder of the lymphatic circulation; at its  worst, it is called elephantiasis. Primary lymphedema is caused by abnormal  development of lymph vessels and may be present at birth (congenital  lymphedema), but more often develops during the teens (lymphedema praecox). It  may also appear later, usually after age 35 (lymphedema tarda). Secondary  lymphedema is due to obstruction or destruction of normal lymphatic channels  due to tumor, surgery, repeated infections, or parasitic infection such as  filariasis. Lymphedema most commonly affects one extremity.\nb. Lymphedema does not meet the requirements of\n4.11\n, although it may medically equal the severity of that listing. \n                We will evaluate lymphedema by considering whether the underlying cause meets or medically equals any listing or whether the lymphedema medically equals a cardiovascular listing, \n                such as\n4.11\n, or a musculoskeletal disorders listing, \n                such as\n1.18\n.\n    If no listing is met or medically equaled, we will evaluate any functional limitations imposed by your lymphedema when we assess  your residual functional capacity.\n5.\nWhen will we purchase exercise Doppler studies for evaluating peripheral arterial disease (PAD)?\nIf we need additional evidence of your PAD, we will generally purchase exercise Doppler studies (see\n4.00C16\nand\n4.00C17\n)\n    when your resting ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio is at least 0.50 but less than 0.80, and only  rarely when it is 0.80 or above.\n    We will not purchase exercise Doppler testing  if you have a disease that results in abnormal arterial calcification or small vessel disease,\n    but will use your resting toe systolic blood pressure or resting toe/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio.\n    (See\n4.00G7c\nand\n4.00G8.\n)  There are no current medical standards for evaluating exercise toe pressures.\n    Because any exercise test stresses your entire cardiovascular system, we will purchase exercise Doppler studies only after an MC, preferably one with experience in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease,\n    has determined that the test would not present a significant risk to you and that there is no  other medical reason not to purchase the test\n    (see\n4.00C6\n,\n4.00C7\n, and\n4.00C8\n).\n6.\nAre there any other studies that are helpful in evaluating PAD?\nDoppler studies done using a  recording ultrasonic Doppler unit and strain-gauge plethysmography are other  useful tools for evaluating PAD. A recording Doppler, which prints a tracing of  the arterial pulse wave in the femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and  posterior tibial arteries, is an excellent evaluation tool to compare wave  forms in normal and compromised peripheral blood flow. Qualitative analysis of  the pulse wave is very helpful in the overall assessment of the severity of the  occlusive disease. Tracings are especially helpful in assessing severity if you  have small vessel disease related to diabetes mellitus or other diseases with  similar vascular changes, or diseases causing medial calcifications when ankle  pressure is either normal or falsely high.\n7.\nHow do we evaluate PAD under\n4.12\n?\na. The ankle blood pressure referred to in\n4.12A\nand\nB\nis the higher of the pressures recorded from the  posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries in the affected leg. \n                The higher pressure recorded from the two sites is the more significant measurement in assessing the extent of arterial insufficiency. \n                Techniques for obtaining ankle systolic blood pressures include Doppler (See\n4.00C16\nand\n4.00C17\n),\n    plethysmographic studies, or other techniques. We will request any available tracings generated by these studies so that we can review them.\nb. In\n4.12A\n, the ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the \n                ankle to the systolic blood pressure at the brachial artery;  both taken at the same time while you are lying on your back. \n                We do not require that the ankle and brachial pressures be taken on the same side of your body.  This is because, as with the ankle pressure, we will use the higher brachial  systolic pressure measured. \n                Listing\n4.12A\nis met when your resting ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio is less than 0.50.\n    If your resting ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio is 0.50 or above, we will use 4.12B to evaluate the severity of your PAD,\n    unless you also have a disease causing abnormal arterial calcification or small vessel disease, such as diabetes mellitus.\n    See\n4.00G7c\nand\n4.00G8\n.\nc. We will use resting toe systolic blood pressures or resting toe/brachial systolic blood pressure ratios \n                (determined the same way as ankle/brachial ratios, see\n4.00G7b\n) when you have intermittent claudication and a disease that results in abnormal \n                arterial calcification (for example, Monckeberg's sclerosis or diabetes mellitus) or small vessel disease (for example, diabetes mellitus). \n                These diseases may result in misleadingly high blood pressure readings at the ankle. However, high  blood pressures due to vascular changes related to these diseases seldom occur at the toe level. \n                While the criteria in\n4.12C\nand\n4.12D\nare intended primarily for individuals who have a disease \n                causing abnormal arterial calcification or small vessel disease, we may also use them for evaluating anyone with PAD.\n8.\nHow are toe pressures measured?\nToe pressures are measured routinely in most vascular laboratories through one of three methods: most frequently, photoplethysmography; less frequently, plethysmography using strain gauge cuffs; \n                and Doppler ultrasound. Toe pressure can also be measured by using any  blood pressure cuff that fits snugly around the big toe and is neither too tight nor too loose. \n                A neonatal cuff or a cuff designed for use on fingers or toes can be used in the measurement of toe pressure.\n9.\nHow do we use listing\n4.12\nif you have had a peripheral graft?\nPeripheral grafting serves the  same purpose as coronary grafting; that is, to bypass a narrow or obstructed  arterial segment. If intermittent claudication recurs or persists after  peripheral grafting, \n                we may purchase Doppler studies to assess the flow of blood  through the bypassed vessel and to establish the current severity of the  peripheral arterial impairment. \n                However, if you have had peripheral grafting  done for your PAD, we will not use the findings from before the surgery to assess the current severity of your impairment, \n                although we will consider the severity and duration of your impairment prior to your surgery in making our determination or decision.\nH.\nEvaluating  Other Cardiovascular Impairments\n1.\nHow will we evaluate  hypertension?\nBecause\nhypertension\n(high blood pressure)  generally causes disability through its effects on other body systems, we will  evaluate it by reference to the specific body system(s) affected (heart, brain,  kidneys, or eyes) when we consider its effects under the listings. We will also  consider any limitations imposed by your hypertension when we assess your  residual functional capacity.\n2.\nHow will we evaluate  symptomatic congenital heart disease? \n                Congenital heart disease\nis any abnormality of the heart or the major blood vessels that is present at birth.  Because of improved treatment methods, \n                more children with congenital heart disease are living to adulthood. Although some types of congenital heart disease may be corrected by surgery, many individuals with treated congenital heart disease \n                continue to have problems throughout their lives (symptomatic congenital heart disease). If you have congenital heart disease that results in chronic heart failure with evidence of ventricular dysfunction \n                or in recurrent arrhythmias, we will evaluate your impairment under\n4.02\nor\n4.05\n.\n    Otherwise, we  will evaluate your impairment under\n4.06\n.\n3.\nWhat is  cardiomyopathy and how will we evaluate it? \n                Cardiomyopathy\nis a disease of the heart muscle. The heart loses its ability to pump blood (heart failure), and in some instances, heart rhythm is disturbed, leading to irregular  heartbeats (arrhythmias). \n                Usually, the exact cause of the muscle damage is  never found (idiopathic cardiomyopathy). There are various types of cardiomyopathy, \n                which fall into two major categories:\nIschemic\nand\nnonischemic\ncardiomyopathy. \n                Ischemic cardiomyopathy typically refers to heart muscle damage  that results from coronary artery disease, including heart attacks. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy includes several types: \n                Dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive.  We will evaluate cardiomyopathy under\n4.02\n,\n4.04\n,\n4.05\n, or\n11.04\n, depending on its effects on you.\n4.\nHow will we evaluate valvular heart disease?\nWe will evaluate valvular heart disease under the listing appropriate for its effect on you. \n                Thus, we may use\n4.02\n,\n4.04\n,\n4.05\n,\n4.06\n,or an appropriate neurological listing in\n11.00ff\n.\n5.\nWhat do we consider when we evaluate heart transplant recipients?\na. After your heart  transplant, we will consider you disabled for 1 year following the surgery  because there is a greater likelihood of rejection of the organ and infection  during the first year.\nb. However, heart transplant  patients generally meet our definition of disability before they undergo  transplantation. We will determine the onset of your disability based on the  facts in your case.\nc. We will not assume that  you became disabled when your name was placed on a transplant waiting list.  This is because you may be placed on a waiting list soon after diagnosis of the  cardiac disorder that may eventually require a transplant. Physicians recognize  that candidates for transplantation often have to wait months or even years  before a suitable donor heart is found, so they place their patients on the  list as soon as permitted.\nd. When we do a continuing  disability review to determine whether you are still disabled, we will evaluate  your residual impairment(s), as shown by symptoms, signs,\n                and laboratory findings, including any side effects of medication. We will consider any remaining  symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings indicative of cardiac dysfunction in  deciding whether medical improvement\n                (as defined in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\n) has occurred.\n6.\nWhen does an aneurysm  have “dissection not controlled by prescribed treatment,\n                ” as required under\n4.10\n?\nAn aneurysm (or bulge in the aorta or one of its major branches) \n                is\ndissecting\nwhen the inner lining of the artery begins to separate from the arterial wall. We consider the dissection not controlled when you have persistence of chest  pain due to progression of the dissection,\n                an increase in the size of the  aneurysm, or compression of one or more branches of the aorta supplying the  heart, kidneys, brain, or other organs. An aneurysm with dissection can cause  heart failure, \n                renal (kidney) failure, or neurological complications. If you have an aneurysm that does not meet the requirements of\n4.10\nand you have one  or more of these associated conditions,\n    we will evaluate the condition(s) using  the appropriate listing.\n7.\nWhat is hyperlipidemia  and how will we evaluate it? Hyperlipidemia\nis the general term for an  elevation of any or all of the lipids (fats or cholesterol) in the blood; for  example, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipoproteinemia.  These disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and transport can cause defects  throughout the body. The effects most likely to interfere with function are  those produced by atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) and coronary  artery disease. We will evaluate your lipoprotein disorder by considering its  effects on you.\n8.\nWhat is Marfan syndrome and how will we evaluate it?\na. Marfan syndrome is a genetic connective tissue disorder that affects multiple body systems,  including the skeleton, eyes, heart, blood vessels, nervous system, skin, and  lungs. There is no specific laboratory test to diagnose Marfan syndrome. The  diagnosis is generally made by medical history, including family history,  physical examination, including an evaluation of the ratio of arm/leg size to  trunk size, a slit lamp eye examination, and a heart test(s), such as an  echocardiogram. In some cases, a genetic analysis may be useful, but such  analyses may not provide any additional helpful information.\nb. The effects of Marfan syndrome can range from mild to severe. In most cases, the disorder progresses as you age. \n                Most individuals with Marfan syndrome have abnormalities associated with the heart and blood vessels. Your heart's mitral valve may leak, causing a  heart murmur. Small leaks may not cause symptoms, \n                but larger ones may cause  shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations. Another effect is that the wall  of the aorta may be weakened and abnormally stretch (aortic dilation). \n                This aortic dilation may tear, dissect, or rupture, causing serious heart problems or sometimes sudden death. We will evaluate the manifestations of your Marfan  syndrome under the appropriate body system criteria, \n                such as\n4.10\n, or if  necessary, consider the functional limitations imposed by your impairment.\nI.\nOther Evaluation Issues\n1.\nWhat effect does obesity have on the cardiovascular system and how will we evaluate it?\nObesity is a medically determinable impairment that is often associated with  disorders of the cardiovascular system. Disturbance of this system can be a  major cause of disability if you have obesity. Obesity may affect the  cardiovascular system because of the increased workload the additional body  mass places on the heart. Obesity may make it harder for the chest and lungs to  expand. This can mean that the respiratory system must work harder to provide  needed oxygen. This in turn would make the heart work harder to pump blood to  carry oxygen to the body. Because the body would be working harder at rest, its  ability to perform additional work would be less than would otherwise be  expected. Thus, the combined effects of obesity with cardiovascular impairments  can be greater than the effects of each of the impairments considered  separately. We must consider any additional and cumulative effects of obesity  when we determine whether you have a severe cardiovascular impairment or a  listing-level cardiovascular impairment (or a combination of impairments that  medically equals the severity of a listed impairment), and when we assess your  residual functional capacity.\n2.\nHow do we relate treatment to functional status?\nIn general, conclusions about the severity of a cardiovascular impairment cannot be made on the basis of type of treatment rendered or anticipated. \n                The amount of function restored and the time required for improvement after treatment (medical, surgical, or a prescribed program of progressive physical activity) vary with the nature and extent of the disorder,  \n                the type of treatment, and other factors. Depending upon the timing of this  treatment in relation to the alleged onset date of disability, \n                we may need to defer evaluation of the impairment for a period of up to 3 months from the date treatment began to permit consideration of treatment effects, \n                unless we can make a determination or decision using the evidence we have. See\n4.00B4\n.\n3.\nHow do we evaluate impairments that do not meet one of the cardiovascular listings?\na. These listings are only examples of common cardiovascular impairments that we consider severe enough to  prevent you from doing any gainful activity. If your severe impairment(s) does  not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether  you have an impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another  body system.\nb. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairments(s) medically equals a listing. \n                (See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\n.)\n    If you have a severe impairment(s) that does not meet or  medically equal the criteria of a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity.\n    Therefore, we  proceed to the fourth and, if necessary, the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in\n    §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\n.\n    If you are an adult, we use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nor\n416.994\n,\n    as appropriate, when we decide whether you  continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

Medical evidence should include your medical history, physical examination findings, operative reports, and relevant laboratory findings.\n2.\nLaboratory findings.\nWe need laboratory reports such as results of imaging (see\n5.00B3\n),\n                            endoscopy, and other diagnostic procedures. We may also need clinical laboratory and pathology results.\n3.\nImaging\nrefers to medical imaging techniques, such as x-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and computerized tomography. The imaging must be consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice as a proper technique to support the evaluation of the disorder.\nBack to Top\nC.\nWhat is chronic liver disease (CLD), and how do we evaluate it under\n5.05\n?\n1.\nGeneral.\nCLD is loss of liver function with cell necrosis (cell death), inflammation, or scarring of the liver that persists for more than 6 months. Common causes of CLD in adults include chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, and prolonged alcohol abuse.\na. We will evaluate your signs of CLD, such as jaundice, changes in size of the liver and spleen, ascites, peripheral edema, and altered mental status. \n                            We will also evaluate your symptoms of CLD, such as pruritus (itching), fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances when we assess the severity of your impairment(s) \n                            and how it affects your ability to function. In the absence of evidence of a chronic liver impairment, episodes of acute liver disease do not meet the requirements of\n5.05\nb.\nLaboratory findings\nof your CLD may include decreased serum albumin, increased International Normalized Ratio (INR), arterial deoxygenation (hypoxemia), increased serum creatinine, oliguria (reduced urine output), or sodium retention. Another laboratory finding that may be included in the evidence is a liver biopsy. If you have had a liver biopsy, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain the results; however, we will not purchase a liver biopsy.\n2.\nManifestations of CLD.\na.\nGastrointestinal hemorrhaging\n(\n5.05A\n), \n                            as a consequence of cirrhosis and high pressure in the liver's portal venous system, may occur from varices (dilated veins in the esophagus or the stomach) or from portal hypertensive gastropathy \n                            (abnormal mucosal changes in the stomach). When gastrointestinal hemorrhaging is due to a cause other than CLD, we evaluate it under\n5.02\n. \n                            The phrase \"consider under a disability for 1 year\" in\n5.02\nand\n5.05A\ndoes not refer to the date on which your disability began, \n                            only to the date on which we must reevaluate whether your impairment(s) continues to meet a listing or is otherwise disabling. \n                            We determine the onset of your disability based on the facts of your case.\nb.\nAscites or hydrothorax\n(\n5.05B\n) is a pathologic accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites)\n                            or pleural space (hydrothorax). Ascites or hydrothorax may be diagnosed by removing some of the fluid with needle aspiration (paracentesis or thoracentesis), physical examination, or imaging.\n                            The most common causes of ascites are portal hypertension and low serum albumin resulting from CLD. We evaluate other causes of ascites and hydrothorax that are unrelated to CLD,\n                            such as congestive heart failure and cancer, under the listings in the affected body systems.\nc.\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)\n(\n5.05C\n) is an acute bacterial infection of peritoneal fluid and is most commonly associated with CLD.\n                            SBP is diagnosed by laboratory analysis of peritoneal fluid (obtained by paracentesis) that contains a neutrophil count (also called absolute neutrophil count) of at least 250 cells/mm\n3\n.\n5.05C\nis satisfied with one evaluation documenting peritoneal infection. We evaluate other causes of peritonitis that are unrelated to CLD, such as tuberculosis,\n                            malignancy, and perforated bowel, under the listings in the affected body systems.\nd.\nHepatorenal syndrome\n(\n5.05D\n) is renal failure associated with CLD in the absence of underlying kidney pathology.\n                            Findings associated with hepatorenal syndrome include elevation of serum creatinine, sodium retention with low urinary sodium excretion, and oliguria.\n                            We evaluate renal dysfunction with known underlying kidney pathology, such as glomerulonephritis, tubular necrosis, and renal infections,\n                            under the listings in\n6.00\n.\ne.\nHepatopulmonary syndrome\n(\n5.05E\n) is arterial deoxygenation due to intrapulmonary vascular dilation and arteriovenous shunting associated with CLD.\n                            Clinical findings of hepatopulmonary syndrome include platypnea (shortness of breath relieved when lying down) and orthodeoxia (low arterial blood oxygen while in the upright position),\n                            when presenting in the context of CLD. We evaluate pulmonary dysfunction with known underlying respiratory pathology, such as asthma, pneumonia,\n                            and pulmonary infections, under the listings in\n3.00\n.\n(i) Under\n5.05E1\n, we require a resting arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement obtained while you are breathing room air;\n                            that is, without oxygen supplementation. The ABG report must include the P\na\nO\n2\nvalue, your name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and State of the test site.\n(ii) We will not purchase the specialized imaging techniques described in\n5.05E2\n; \n                            however, if you have had the test(s) at a time relevant to your claim, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain the report.\nf.\nHepatic encephalopathy\n(\n5.05F\n), also known as portosystemic encephalopathy, \n                            is a recurrent or chronic neuropsychiatric disorder associated with CLD.\n(i) Under\n5.05F2\n, we require documentation of a mental impairment associated with hepatic encephalopathy. \n                            A mental impairment can include abnormal behavior, changes in mental status, or an altered state of consciousness. Reports of abnormal behavior may show that you are experiencing delusions, \n                            paranoia, or hallucinations. Reports of changes in mental status may show change in sleep patterns, personality or mood changes, poor concentration, or poor judgment or cognitive dysfunction \n                            (for example, impaired memory, poor problem-solving ability, or attention deficits). Reports of altered state of consciousness may show that you are experiencing confusion, delirium, or stupor.\n(ii) Signs and laboratory findings that document the severity of hepatic encephalopathy when not attributable to other causes may include a \"flapping tremor\" (asterixis), \n                            characteristic abnormalities found on an electroencephalogram (EEG), or abnormal serum albumin or coagulation values. We will not purchase an EEG; however, if you have had this test at a time relevant to your claim, \n                            we will make every reasonable effort to obtain the report for the purpose of establishing whether your impairment meets the criteria of\n5.05F\n.\n(iii) We will not evaluate acute encephalopathy under\n5.05F\nif it results from conditions other than CLD. \n                            For example, we will evaluate acute encephalopathy caused by vascular events under the listings in\n11.00\nand acute encephalopathy caused by cancer under the listings in\n13.00\n.\n3.\nSSA Chronic Liver Disease (SSA CLD) score\n(\n5.05G\n). \n                            Listing\n5.05G\nrequires two SSA CLD scores, each requiring three or four laboratory values. \n                            The \"date of the SSA CLD score\" is the date of the earliest of the three or four laboratory values used for its calculation. \n                            The date of the second SSA CLD score must be at least 60 days after the date of the first SSA CLD score and both scores must be within the required 12-month period. \n                            If you have the two SSA CLD scores required by\n5.05G\n, \n                            we will find that your impairment meets the criteria of the listing from at least the date of the first SSA CLD score. [We provide the\nSSA CLD Calculator\nto calculate SSA CLD scores as described below.]\na. We calculate the SSA CLD score using a formula that includes up to four laboratory values: Serum creatinine (mg/dL), total bilirubin (mg/dL), INR, and under certain conditions, serum sodium (mmol/L). The SSA CLD score calculation contains at least one, and sometimes two, parts, as described in (i) and (ii).\n(i) The initial calculation is:\nSSA CLD\ni\n=\n9.57 × [log\ne\n(serum creatinine mg/dL)]\n+ 3.78 × [log\ne\n(serum total bilirubin mg/dL)]\n+11.2 × [log\ne\n(INR)]\n+ 6.43\nrounded to the nearest whole integer.\n(ii) If the value from the initial calculation is 11 or below, the SSA CLD score will be the SSA CLD\ni\nvalue. If the value from the initial calculation is greater than 11, the SSA CLD score will be re-calculated as:\nSSA CLD =\nSSA CLD\ni\n+ 1.32 × (137−serum sodium mmol/L)\n−[0.033 × SSA CLD\ni\n× (137−serum sodium mmol/L)]\n(iii) We round the results of your SSA CLD score calculation to the nearest whole integer to arrive at your SSA CLD score.\nb. For any SSA CLD score calculation, all of the required laboratory values (serum creatinine, serum total bilirubin, INR, and serum sodium) must have been obtained within a continuous 30-day period.\n(i) We round values for serum creatinine (mg/dL), serum total bilirubin (mg/dL), or INR less than 1.0 up to 1.0 to calculate your SSA CLD score.\n(ii) We round values for serum creatinine (mg/dL) greater than 4.0 down to 4.0 to calculate your SSA CLD score.\n(iii) If there are multiple laboratory values within the 30-day interval for serum creatinine (mg/dL), serum total bilirubin (mg/dL), or INR, we use the highest value to calculate your SSA CLD score. We will not use any INR values derived from testing done while you are on anticoagulant treatment in our SSA CLD calculation.\n(iv) If there are multiple laboratory values within the 30-day interval for serum sodium (mmol/L), we use the lowest value to calculate your SSA CLD score.\n(v) If you are in renal failure or on renal dialysis within a week of any serum creatinine test in the period used for the SSA CLD calculation, we will use a serum creatinine value of 4.0, which is the maximum serum creatinine level allowed in the calculation, to calculate your SSA CLD score.\n(vi) If your serum sodium is less than 125 mmol/L, we will set your serum sodium to 125 mmol/L for purposes of calculation of the SSA CLD score. If your serum sodium is higher than 137 mmol/L, we will set your serum sodium to 137 mmol/L for purposes of calculation of the SSA CLD score.\nc. When we indicate “log\ne\n” (also abbreviated “ln”) in the formula for the SSA CLD score calculation, we mean the \"base\ne\nlogarithm\" or \"natural logarithm\" of the numerical laboratory value, \n                            not the \"base 10 logarithm\" or \"common logarithm\" (log) of the laboratory value, and not the actual laboratory value. For example, if a person has laboratory values of serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, \n                            serum total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, INR 1.32, and serum sodium 119 mmol/L, we compute the SSA CLD score as follows:\nSSA CLD\ni\n=\n9.57 × [log\ne\n(serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL) = 0.336]\n+ 3.78 × [log\ne\n(serum total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL) = 0.262]\n+ 11.2 × [log\ne\n(INR 1.32) = .278]\n+ 6.43\n= 3.22 + 0.99 + 3.11 + 6.43\n= 13.75, which we round to an SSA CLD\ni\nscore of 14.\nBecause the SSA CLD\ni\nscore is over 11, we then move to the second step of calculating the SSA CLD:\nSSA CLD = 14\n+ 1.32 × (137−serum sodium 125 mmol/L)\n−[0.033 × SSA CLD\ni\n14 × (137−serum sodium 125 mmol/L)\n= 14 + 15.84−5.54\n= 24.3, which we round to an SSA CLD score of 24.\nBack to Top\nD.\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and how do we evaluate it under\n5.06\n?\n1. IBD is a group of inflammatory conditions of the small intestine and colon. The most common IBD disorders are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Remissions and exacerbations of variable duration are a hallmark of IBD.\n2. We evaluate your signs and symptoms of IBD, such as diarrhea, fecal incontinence, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, abdominal tenderness, \n                            palpable abdominal mass (usually inflamed loops of bowel), and perianal disease (for example, fissure, fistulas, abscesses, or anal canal stenosis), when we assess the severity of your impairment(s). \n                            You may require supplemental daily nutrition due to IBD. There are two forms of supplemental daily nutrition we consider under\n5.06B5\n: \n                            enteral nutrition (delivered directly to a part of your digestive system) via a gastrostomy, duodenostomy, or jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition delivered via a central venous catheter. \n                            Enteral tube feedings delivered via nasal or oral tubes do not satisfy the requirement in\n5.06B5\n.\n3. Surgical diversion of the intestinal tract, including ileostomy and colostomy, does not preclude the ability to perform any gainful activity if you are able to maintain adequate nutrition and function of the stoma. \n                            However, if you are not able to maintain adequate nutrition, we will evaluate your impairment under\n5.08\n.\n4. IBD may also be associated with significant extraintestinal manifestations in a variety of body systems. These include, but are not limited to, involvement of the eye (for example, uveitis, episcleritis, or iritis); \n                            hepatobiliary disease (for example, gallstones or primary sclerosing cholangitis); urologic disease (for example, kidney stones or obstructive hydronephrosis); \n                            skin involvement (for example, erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum); or non-destructive inflammatory arthritis. You may also have associated thromboembolic disorders or vascular disease. \n                            These manifestations may not correlate with the severity of your IBD. If your impairment does not meet any of the criteria of\n5.06\n,\n                            we will consider the effects of your extraintestinal manifestations in determining whether you have an impairment(s) that meets or medically equals another listing, and when we assess your residual functional capacity.\n5.\nRepeated complications of IBD.\na. Examples of complications of IBD include abscesses, intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, infectious colitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, ureteral obstruction, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and hypercoagulable state (which may lead to thromboses or embolism). When we evaluate repeated complications of IBD, we consider all relevant information in your case record to determine the effects of your IBD on your ability to function independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis. Factors we consider include, but are not limited to: your symptoms, the frequency and duration of your complications, periods of exacerbation and remission, and the functional effects of your treatment, including the side effects of your medication. Your impairment will satisfy this criterion regardless of whether you have the same kind of complication repeatedly, all different complications, or any other combination of complications; for example, two of the same kind of complication and a different one.\nb. To satisfy the requirements described under\n5.06C\n, \n                            your IBD must result in repeated complications and marked limitation in one of three areas of functioning: activities of daily living; maintaining social functioning; \n                            or completing tasks in a timely manner due to deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace. \n                            If the complications do not last as long or occur as frequently as required under\n5.06C\n, \n                            we will consider whether your IBD medically equals the listing.\nc.\nMarked\nlimitation means that the signs and symptoms of your IBD interfere seriously with your ability to function. Although we do not require the use of such a scale, “marked” would be the fourth point on a five-point rating scale consisting of no limitation, mild limitation, moderate limitation, marked limitation, and extreme limitation. We do not define “marked” by a specific number of activities of daily living or different behaviors in which your social functioning is impaired, or a specific number of tasks that you are able to complete, but by the nature and overall degree of interference with your functioning. You may have marked limitation when several activities or functions are impaired, or when only one is impaired. Additionally, you need not be totally precluded from performing an activity to have marked limitation, as long as the degree of limitation interferes seriously with your ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively. The term \"marked\" does not imply that you must be confined to bed, hospitalized, or in a nursing home.\nd.\nActivities of daily living\ninclude, but are not limited to, such activities as doing household chores, grooming and hygiene, using a post office, taking public transportation, or paying bills. We will find that you have “marked” limitation in activities of daily living if you have a serious limitation in your ability to maintain a household or take public transportation because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, caused by your IBD (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to perform some self-care activities.\ne.\nMaintaining social functioning\nincludes the capacity to interact independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis with others. It includes the ability to communicate effectively with others. We will find that you have “marked” limitation in maintaining social functioning if you have a serious limitation in social interaction on a sustained basis because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, or a pattern of exacerbation and remission, caused by your IBD (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to communicate with close friends or relatives.\nf.\nCompleting tasks in a timely manner due to deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace\ninvolves the ability to sustain concentration, persistence, or pace to permit timely completion of tasks commonly found in work settings. We will find that you have “marked” limitation in completing tasks if you have a serious limitation in your ability to sustain concentration or pace adequate to complete work-related tasks because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, caused by your IBD (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to do some routine activities of daily living.\nBack to Top\nE.\nWhat is intestinal failure, and how do we evaluate it under\n5.07\n?\n1.\nIntestinal failure\nis a condition resulting in gut function below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients or water and electrolytes, \n                            resulting in a requirement for intravenous supplementation (\ni.e.,\nparenteral nutrition) to maintain health. Examples of conditions that may result in intestinal failure include short bowel syndrome, extensive small bowel mucosal disease, \n                            and chronic motility disorders.\n2.\nShort bowel syndrome\nis a malabsorption disorder that occurs when ischemic vascular insults (caused, for example, by volvulus or necrotizing enterocolitis), trauma, or IBD complications require(s) surgical resection of any amount of the small intestine, resulting in chronic malnutrition.\n3.\nExtensive small bowel mucosal disease\nmeans that the mucosal surface of the small bowel does not efficiently absorb nutrients or loses nutrients. \n                            Common causes of small bowel mucosal disease include microvillous inclusion disease and tufting enteropathy.\n4.\nChronic motility disorder\nrefers to a chronic disorder of the propulsion of gut content without fixed obstructions, causing intolerance to oral nutrition and inadequate nutritional intake. This type of disorder may also be known as a chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), because the gut dysfunction mimics that of an obstructed intestine, but without evidence of an actual obstruction. Primary CIPO may have an unknown underlying cause. Chronic motility disorders may also result from congenital, neuromuscular, or autoimmune conditions, such as gastroschisis, omphalocele, long segment Hirschprung's disease, Crohn's disease, and mitochondrial disorders.\n5. For short bowel syndrome, we require a copy of the operative report that includes details of the surgical findings, or postoperative imaging indicating a resection of the small intestine. \n                            If we cannot get one of these reports, we need other medical reports that include details of the surgical findings. For other chronic motility disorders or extensive small bowel mucosal disease, \n                            we need medical reports that include details of your intestinal dysfunction. For any impairment evaluated under\n5.07\n, \n                            we also need medical documentation that you are dependent on daily parenteral nutrition to provide most of your nutritional requirements.\nBack to Top\nF.\nHow do we evaluate weight loss due to any digestive disorder under\n5.08\n?\n1. In addition to the impairments specifically mentioned in these listings, other digestive disorders, such as esophageal stricture, pancreatic insufficiency, and malabsorption, may result in significant weight loss. \n                            Impairments other than digestive disorders that cause weight loss should be evaluated under the appropriate body system for that impairment. \n                            For instance, weight loss as a result of chronic kidney disease should be evaluated under our rules for genitourinary disorders (see\n6.00\n), \n                            and weight loss as the result of an eating disorder should be evaluated under our rules for mental disorders (see\n12.00\n). \n                            However, if you develop a digestive disorder as the result of your other impairment, we will evaluate the acquired digestive disorder under our rules for digestive disorders. \n                            We evaluate weight loss due to any digestive disorder under\n5.08\nby using the body mass index (BMI).\n2. BMI is the ratio of your weight to the square of your height. Calculation and interpretation of the BMI are independent of gender in adults.\na. We calculate BMI using inches and pounds, meters and kilograms, or centimeters and kilograms. We must have measurements of your weight and height without shoes for these calculations.\nb. We calculate BMI using one of the following formulas:\nEnglish Formula\nBMI = [Weight in Pounds/(Height in Inches × Height in Inches)] × 703\nMetric Formulas\nBMI = Weight in Kilograms/(Height in Meters × Height in Meters)\nBMI = [Weight in Kilograms/(Height in Centimeters × Height in Centimeters)] × 10,000\nBack to Top\nG.\nHow do we evaluate digestive organ transplantation?\nIf you receive a liver (\n5.09\n), small intestine (\n5.11\n), \n                            or pancreas (\n5.12\n) transplant, we will consider you disabled under the listing for 1 year from the date of the transplant. \n                            After that, we evaluate your residual impairment(s) by considering the adequacy of your post-transplant function, \n                            the frequency and severity of any rejection episodes you have, complications in other body systems, and adverse treatment effects. \n                            People who receive digestive organ transplants generally have impairments that meet our definition of disability before they undergo transplantation. \n                            The phrase \"consider under a disability for 1 year\" in\n5.09\n,\n5.11\n, \n                            and\n5.12\ndoes not refer to the date on which your disability began, only to the date on which we must reevaluate whether your impairment(s) continues to meet a listing or is otherwise disabling. \n                            We determine the onset of your disability based on the facts of your case.\nH.\nHow do we evaluate your digestive disorder if there is no record of ongoing treatment?\nIf there is no record of ongoing treatment despite the existence of a severe impairment(s), we will assess the severity and duration of your digestive disorder based on the current medical and other evidence in your case record. If there is no record of ongoing treatment, you may not be able to show an impairment that meets a digestive disorders listing, but your impairment may medically equal a listing, or be disabling based on consideration of your residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience.\nI.\nHow do we evaluate your digestive disorder if there is evidence establishing a substance use disorder?\nIf we find that you are disabled and there is medical evidence in your case record establishing that you have a substance use disorder,\n                            we will determine whether your substance use disorder is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.\n                            See §§\n404.1535\nand\n416.935\nof this chapter.\n                            Digestive disorders resulting from drug or alcohol use are often chronic in nature and will not necessarily improve with cessation in drug or alcohol use.\nBack to Top\nJ.\nHow do we evaluate digestive disorders that do not meet one of these listings?\n1. These listings are only examples of common digestive disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity. If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have an impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another body system.\n2.

When we cannot get a copy of the pathology  report, we will accept a statement from an acceptable medical source verifying  that a biopsy was performed and describing the results.\nC. What other factors do we consider when we evaluate your genitourinary disorder?\nChronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis\n.\nDialysis is a treatment for CKD that uses artificial means to remove toxic metabolic byproducts from the blood.\n                          Hemodialysis uses an artificial kidney machine to clean waste products from the blood;\n                          peritoneal dialysis uses a dialyzing solution that is introduced into and removed from the abdomen (peritoneal cavity) either continuously or intermittently.\n                          Under\n6.03\n, your ongoing dialysis must have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\n                          To satisfy the requirements in\n6.03\n, we will accept a report from an acceptable medical source that describes your CKD and your current dialysis,\n                          and indicates that your dialysis will be ongoing.\nIf you are undergoing chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, your CKD may meet our definition  of disability before you started dialysis. We will determine the onset of your  disability based on the facts in your case record.\nKidney transplant.\nIf you receive a kidney transplant, we will consider you to be disabled under\n6.04\nfor 1 year from the date of transplant.\n                      After that, we will evaluate your residual  impairment(s) by considering your post-transplant function, any rejection  episodes you have had, complications in other body systems,\n                      and any adverse effects related to ongoing treatment.\nIf you received a kidney transplant, your CKD may meet our definition of disability before you  received the transplant. We will determine the onset of your disability based  on the facts in your case record.\nRenal osteodystrophy\n. This condition is the bone degeneration resulting from chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).\n                  CKD-MBD occurs when the kidneys are unable to maintain the necessary levels of  minerals, hormones, and vitamins required for bone structure and function.\n                  Under\n6.05B1\n, “severe bone pain” means frequent or intractable (resistant to  treatment)\n                  bone pain that interferes with physical activity or mental functioning.\nPeripheral neuropathy\n. This disorder results when the kidneys do not adequately filter toxic substances from the blood. These toxins can adversely affect nerve tissue.\n                  The resulting neuropathy may affect peripheral motor or  sensory nerves, or both, causing pain, numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness in various parts of the body.\n                  Under\n6.05B2\n, the peripheral neuropathy must be a severe impairment.\n                  (See §§\n404.1520(c)\n,\n404.1521\n,\n416.920(c)\n,\n                  and\n416.921\nof this chapter.)\n                  It must also have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\nFluidoverload syndrome\n. This condition occurs when excess sodium and water retention in the body due to CKD results in vascular congestion.\n                  Under\n6.05B3\n, we need a description of a physical examination that documents signs and symptoms of vascular congestion, such as congestive heart failure,\n                  pleural effusion (excess fluid in the chest), ascites (excess fluid in the abdomen), hypertension, fatigue, shortness of breath, or peripheral edema.\nAnasarca\n(generalized massive edema or swelling).\n                  Under\n6.05B3\nand\n6.06B\n, we need a description of the extent of edema,\n                  including pretibial (in front of the tibia), periorbital (around the eyes), or presacral (in front of the sacrum) edema. We also need a description of any ascites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion.\nAnorexia (diminished appetite) with weight loss\n. Anorexia is a frequent sign of CKD and can result in weight loss.\n                  We will use body mass index (BMI) to determine the  severity of your weight loss under\n6.05B4\n.\n                  (BMI is the ratio of your measured  weight to the square of your measured height.)\n                  We calculate your BMI using the formulas in the digestive disorders body system (\n5.00\n).\nComplications of CKD\n.\n                  The hospitalizations in\n6.09\nmay be for  different complications of CKD.\n                  Examples of complications from CKD that may  result in hospitalization include stroke, congestive heart failure,  hypertensive crisis, or acute kidney failure requiring a short course of  hemodialysis.\n                  If the CKD complication occurs during a hospitalization that was  initially for a co-occurring condition, we will evaluate it under our rules for  determining medical equivalence.\n                  (See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.)  We will evaluate co-occurring conditions,\n                  including those that result in hospitalizations, under the  listings for the affected body system or under our rules for medical  equivalence.\nD.\nHow do we evaluate disorders that do not meet one of the genitourinary listings?\nThe listed disorders are only examples of common genitourinary disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity. If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider  whether you have an impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in  another body system.\nIf you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n                  (See  §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.)\n                  Genitourinary disorders may be associated with disorders in other body systems, and we consider the combined effects of multiple impairments when we determine whether they medically equal a listing.\n                  If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal the criteria  of a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to  engage in substantial gainful activity.\n                  We proceed to the fourth and, if necessary,\n                  the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter.\n                  We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this  chapter, as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

    "full_text": "7.00 Hematological Disorders\nA.\nWhat hematological disorders do we evaluate under these listings?\nWe evaluate non-malignant (non-cancerous) hematological disorders, such as hemolytic anemias (\n7.05\n), \n              disorders of thrombosis and hemostasis (\n7.08\n), and disorders of bone marrow failure (\n7.10\n).\n    These disorders disrupt the normal development and function of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, and clotting-factor proteins (factors).\nWe evaluate malignant (cancerous) hematological disorders, such as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma, \n          under the appropriate listings in\n13.00\n,\n    except for two lymphomas associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n    We evaluate primary central nervous system lymphoma associated with HIV infection under\n14.11B\n,\n    and primary effusion lymphoma associated with HIV infection under\n14.11C\n.\nB.\nWhat evidence do we need to document that you have a hematological disorder?\nWe need the following evidence to document that you have a hematological disorder:\nA laboratory report of a definitive test that establishes a hematological disorder, signed by a physician; or\nA laboratory report of a definitive test that establishes a hematological disorder\n                  that is not signed by a physician and a report from a physician that states you have the disorder; or\nWhen we do not have a laboratory report of a definitive test, a persuasive\n                  report from a physician that a diagnosis of your hematological disorder was\n                  confirmed by appropriate laboratory analysis or other diagnostic method(s).\n                  To be persuasive, this report must state that you had the appropriate definitive\n                  laboratory test or tests for diagnosing your disorder and provide the results, or\n                  explain how your diagnosis was established by other diagnostic method(s) consistent\n                  with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\nWe will make every reasonable effort to obtain the results of\n                  appropriate laboratory testing you have had. We will not purchase complex,\n                  costly, or invasive tests, such as tests of clotting-factor proteins,\n                  and bone marrow aspirations.\nC.\nWhat are hemolytic anemias, and how do we evaluate them under\n7.05\n?\nHemolytic anemias, both congenital and acquired,\nare disorders that result\n                  in premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs). Hemolytic disorders include\n                  abnormalities of hemoglobin structure (hemoglobinopathies), abnormal RBC enzyme\n                  content and function, and RBC membrane (envelope) defects that are congenital or acquired.\n                  The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is based on hemoglobin electrophoresis or analysis of\n                  the contents of the RBC (enzymes) and membrane. Examples of congenital hemolytic anemias\n                  include sickle cell disease, thalassemia and their variants, and hereditary spherocytosis.\n                  Acquired hemolytic anemias may result from autoimmune disease (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus)\n                  or mechanical devices (for example, heart valves, intravascular patches).\nThe hospitalizations in\n7.05B\ndo not all have to be for the same complication of the hemolytic anemia. \n                  They may be for three different complications of the disorder. Examples of complications of hemolytic anemia that may result in\n                  hospitalization include osteomyelitis, painful (vaso-occlusive) crisis, pulmonary infections or infarctions, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, \n                  chronic heart failure, gallbladder disease, hepatic (liver) failure, renal (kidney) failure, nephrotic syndrome, aplastic crisis, and stroke. \n                  We will count the hours you receive emergency treatment in a comprehensive sickle cell disease center immediately before the hospitalization if this treatment is comparable to the treatment provided in a\n                hospital emergency department.\nFor\n7.05C\n, we do not require hemoglobin to be measured during a period in which you are free of pain or other symptoms of your disorder. \n                We will accept hemoglobin measurements made while you are experiencing complications of your hemolytic anemia.\n7.05D\nrefers to the most serious type of beta thalassemia major in which the bone marrow cannot produce sufficient numbers of normal RBCs \n              to maintain life. The only available treatments for beta thalassemia major are life-long RBC transfusions (sometimes called hypertransfusion) or bone marrow transplantation. \n              For purposes of\n7.05D\n, \n              we do not consider prophylactic RBC transfusions to prevent strokes or other complications in sickle cell disease and its variants to be of equal significance to life-saving RBC transfusions for beta thalassemia major. \n              However, we will consider the functional limitations associated with prophylactic RBC transfusions and any associated side effects (for example, iron overload) under\n7.18\nand any affected body system(s).\n               We will also evaluate strokes and resulting complications under\n11.00\nand\n12.00\n.\nD.\nWhat are disorders of thrombosis and hemostasis, and how do we evaluate them under\n7.08\n?\nDisorders of thrombosis and hemostasis\ninclude both clotting and bleeding disorders, and may be congenital or acquired. These disorders are characterized by abnormalities in blood clotting that result in hypercoagulation (excessive blood clotting) or hypocoagulation (inadequate blood clotting). The diagnosis of a thrombosis or hemostasis disorder is based on evaluation of plasma clotting-factor proteins (factors) and platelets. Protein C or protein S deficiency and Factor V Leiden are examples of hypercoagulation disorders. Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and thrombocytopenia are examples of\n                  hypocoagulation disorders. Acquired excessive blood clotting may result from blood protein defects and acquired inadequate blood clotting (for example, acquired\n                  hemophilia A) may be associated with inhibitor autoantibodies.\nThe hospitalizations in\n7.08\ndo not all have to be for the same complication\n                    of a disorder of thrombosis and hemostasis. They may be for three different\n                    complications of the disorder. Examples of complications that may result in\n                    hospitalization include anemias, thromboses, embolisms, and uncontrolled bleeding\n                    requiring multiple factor concentrate infusions or platelet transfusions. We will\n                    also consider any surgery that you have, even if it is not related to your hematological\n                    disorder, to be a complication of your disorder of thrombosis and hemostasis if\n                    you require treatment with clotting-factor proteins\n                    (for example, factor VIII or factor IX) or anticoagulant medication to control\n                    bleeding or coagulation in connection with your surgery. We will count the hours\n                    you receive emergency treatment in a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center\n                    immediately before the hospitalization if this treatment is comparable to the\n                    treatment provided in a hospital emergency department.\nE.\nWhat are disorders of bone marrow failure, and how do we evaluate them under\n7.10\n?\nDisorders of bone marrow failure\nmay be congenital or acquired, characterized\n                  by bone marrow that does not make enough healthy RBCs, platelets, or granulocytes\n                  (specialized types of white blood cells); there may also be a combined failure of\n                  these bone marrow-produced cells. The diagnosis is based on peripheral blood smears\n                  and bone marrow aspiration or bone marrow biopsy, but not peripheral blood smears\n                  alone. Examples of these disorders are myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia,\n                  granulocytopenia, and myelofibrosis. Acquired disorders of bone marrow failure may\n                  result from viral infections, chemical exposure, or immunologic disorders.\nThe hospitalizations in\n7.10A\ndo not all have to be for the same complication\n                    of bone marrow failure. They may be for three different complications of the disorder.\n                    Examples of complications that may result in hospitalization include uncontrolled\n                    bleeding, anemia, and systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.\nFor\n7.10B\n, the requirement of life-long RBC transfusions to maintain life in\n                myelodysplastic syndromes or aplastic anemias has the same meaning as it does\n                for beta thalassemia major (see\n7.00C4\n).\nF.\nHow do we evaluate bone marrow or stem cell transplantation under\n7.17\n?\nWe will consider you to be disabled for 12 months from the date of bone\n          marrow or stem cell transplantation, or we may consider you to be disabled for a longer period if you are experiencing any serious post-transplantation complications, such as graft-versus-host (GVH) disease, frequent infections\n          after immunosuppressive therapy, or significant deterioration of organ systems. We do not restrict our determination of the onset of disability to the date of\n          the transplantation in\n7.17\n. We may establish an earlier onset date of disability due to your transplantation if evidence in your case record\n    supports such a finding.\nG.\nHow do we use the functional criteria in\n7.18\n?\nWhen we use the functional criteria in\n7.18\n, we consider all relevant\n                    information in your case record to determine the impact of your hematological\n                    disorder on your ability to function independently, appropriately, effectively,\n                    and on a sustained basis in a work setting. Factors we will consider when we\n                    evaluate your functioning under\n7.18\ninclude, but are not limited to: your\n                    symptoms, the frequency and duration of complications of your hematological\n                    disorder, periods of exacerbation and remission, and the functional impact of\n                    your treatment, including the side effects of your medication.\nRepeated complications\nmeans that the complications occur on an average of three times a year, or once every 4 months, each lasting 2 weeks or more;\n                  or the complications do not last for 2 weeks but occur substantially more frequently than three times in a year or once every 4 months; or they occur less frequently than an average of three times a year or once every 4 months\n                  but last substantially longer than 2 weeks. Your impairment will satisfy this criterion regardless of whether you have the same kind of complication repeatedly, all different complications, or any other combination of complications; for example, two of the same kind of complication and a\n                  different one. You must have the required number of complications with the frequency and duration required in this section. Additionally, the complications must occur within the period we are considering in connection\n                  with your application or continuing disability review.\nTo satisfy the functional criteria in\n7.18\n, \n                  your hematological disorder must result in a \"marked\" level of limitation in one of three general areas of functioning: \n                  activities of daily living, social functioning, or difficulties in completing tasks due to deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace. \n                  Functional limitations may result from the impact of the disease process itself on your mental functioning, physical functioning, or both your mental and physical functioning. \n                  This limitation could result from persistent or intermittent symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, or malaise, resulting in a limitation of your ability to do a task, to concentrate, to persevere at a task, \n                  or to perform the task at an acceptable rate of speed. (\nSevere fatigue\nmeans a frequent sense of exhaustion that results in significant reduced physical activity \n                  or mental function.\nMalaise\nmeans frequent feelings of illness, bodily discomfort, or lack of well-being that result in significantly reduced physical activity or mental function.) \n                  You may also have limitations because of your treatment and its side effects.\nMarked\nlimitation means that the symptoms and signs of your hematological disorder interfere\nseriously\nwith your ability to function. Although we do not require the use of such a scale, \"marked\" would be the fourth point on a\n                  five-point scale consisting of no limitation, mild limitation, moderate limitation, marked limitation, and extreme limitation. We do not define \"marked\" by a specific number of different activities of daily living or\n                  different behaviors in which your social functioning is impaired, or a specific number of tasks that you are able to complete, but by the nature and overall degree of interference with your functioning. You may have a marked limitation when several activities or functions are impaired, or even when only one is impaired. Additionally, you need not be totally precluded from performing an activity to have a marked limitation, as long\n                  as the degree of limitation interferes seriously with your ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively. The term \"marked\" does not imply\n                  that you must be confined to bed, hospitalized, or in a nursing home.\nActivities of daily living\ninclude, but are not limited to, such activities as doing household chores, grooming and hygiene, using a post office, taking public transportation, or paying bills. We will find that\n                  you have a \"marked\" limitation in activities of daily living if you have a serious limitation in your ability to maintain a household or take public transportation because of symptoms such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, caused by your hematological\n                  disorder (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to perform some self-care activities.\nSocial functioning\nincludes the capacity to interact with others independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis. It includes the ability to communicate effectively with others. We will find that you have a \"marked\" limitation in maintaining social functioning if you have a serious limitation in social interaction on\n                  a sustained basis because of symptoms such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, or a pattern of exacerbation and remission, caused by your hematological disorder (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to communicate with close friends or relatives.\nCompleting tasks in a timely manner\ninvolves the ability to sustain concentration, persistence, or pace to permit timely completion of tasks commonly found in work settings. We will find that you have a \"marked\" limitation in completing tasks if you have a serious limitation in your\n                  ability to sustain concentration or pace adequate to complete work-related tasks because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating caused by your hematological disorder\n                  (including complications of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to do some routine activities of daily living.\nH.\nHow do we consider your symptoms, including your pain, severe fatigue, and malaise?\nYour symptoms, including pain, severe fatigue, and malaise, may be important factors in our determination whether your hematological\n          disorder(s) meets or medically equals a listing, or in our determination whether you are otherwise able to work. We  cannot consider your symptoms unless you have medical signs or laboratory findings showing the existence of a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be\n          expected to produce the symptoms. If you have such an impairment(s), we will evaluate the intensity, persistence, \n          and functional effects of your symptoms using the rules throughout\n7.00\nand in our other regulations.\n    (See  sections\n404.1521\n,\n404.1529\n,\n416.921\n, and\n416.929\nof this chapter)\n    Additionally, when we assess the credibility of your complaints about your symptoms and their functional effects, we will not draw any inferences from the fact that you do not receive treatment or that\n    you are not following treatment without considering all of the relevant evidence in your case record, including any explanations you\n    provide that may explain why you are not receiving or following treatment.\nI.\nHow do we evaluate episodic events in hematological disorders?\nSome of the listings in this body system require a specific number of events within a consecutive 12-month period. \n          (See\n7.05\n,\n7.08\n, and\n7.10A\n.) When we use such criteria, a consecutive 12-month period means a\n    period of 12 consecutive months, all or part of which must occur within the period we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disability review. These events must occur at least 30 days apart to ensure that we are evaluating separate events.\nJ.\nHow do we evaluate hematological disorders that do not meet one of these listings?\nThese listings are only common examples of hematological disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity. If your disorder does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must consider whether you have a disorder that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another body system. For example, we will evaluate hemophilic joint deformity or bone or\n                  joint pain from myelofibrosis under\n1.00\n;\n    polycythemia vera under\n3.00\n,\n4.00\n,\n    or\n11.00\n; chronic iron overload resulting from repeated RBC transfusion (transfusion hemosiderosis) under\n3.00\n,\n4.00\n, \n              or\n5.00\n;\n            and the effects of intracranial bleeding or stroke under\n11.00\nor\n12.00\n.\nIf you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing. \n              (See sections\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.) \n                                Hematological disorders may be associated with disorders in other body systems,\n                                and we consider the combined effects of multiple impairments when we determine whether they medically equal a listing.\n                                If your impairment(s) does not medically equal a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity.\n                                We proceed to the fourth, and, if necessary, the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in sections\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\n.\n                                We use the rules in sections\n404.1594\n,\n416.994\n,\n                                and\n416.994a\nof this chapter, as appropriate,\n                                when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

    "full_text": "8.00 Skin Disorders\nA.\nWhich skin disorders do we evaluate under these listings?\nWe use these listings to evaluate skin disorders that result from hereditary, congenital, or acquired pathological processes.\n                     We evaluate genetic photosensitivity disorders (\n8.07\n), burns (\n8.08\n),\n                     and chronic conditions of the skin or mucous membranes such as ichthyosis, bullous disease, dermatitis, psoriasis,\n                     and hidradenitis suppurativa (\n8.09\n) under these listings.\nB.\nWhat are our definitions for the following terms used in this body system?\n1.\nAssistive device(s):\nAn assistive device, for the purposes of these listings, is any device used to improve stability, dexterity, or mobility. An assistive device can be hand-held, such as a cane(s), a crutch(es), or a walker; used in a seated position, such as a wheelchair, rollator, or power operated vehicle; or worn, such as a prosthesis or an orthosis.\n2.\nChronic skin lesions:\nChronic skin lesions can have recurrent exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n). They can occur despite prescribed medical treatment.\n                     These chronic skin lesions can develop on any part of your body, including upper extremities, lower extremities, palms of your hands, soles of your feet, the perineum,\n                     inguinal (groin) region, and axillae (underarms).\n                     Chronic skin lesions may result in functional limitations as described in\n8.00D2\n.\n3.\nContractures:\nContractures are permanent fibrous scar tissue resulting in tightening and thickening of skin that prevents normal movement of the damaged area.\n                     They can develop on any part of your musculoskeletal system, including upper extremities, lower extremities, palms of your hands, soles of your feet, the perineum, inguinal (groin) region,\n                     and axillae (underarms). Contractures may result in functional limitations as described in\n8.00D2\n.\n4.\nDocumented medical need:\nWhen we use the term \"documented medical need,\" we mean that there is evidence\n                     (see  §§\n404.1513\nand\n416.913\nof this chapter)\n                     from your medical source(s) in the medical record that supports your need for an assistive device\n                     (see\n8.00B1\n) for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\n                     The evidence must include documentation from your medical source(s) describing any limitation(s) in your upper or lower extremity functioning that supports your need for the assistive device\n                     and describing the circumstances for which you need it. The evidence does not have to include a specific prescription for the device.\n5.\nFine and gross movements:\nFine movements, for the purposes of these listings, involve use of your wrists, hands, and fingers; such movements include picking, pinching, manipulating, and fingering. Gross movements involve use of your shoulders, upper arms, forearms, and hands; such movements include handling, gripping, grasping, holding, turning, and reaching. Gross movements also include exertional activities such as lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling.\n6.\nSurgical management:\nFor the purposes of these listings, surgical management includes the surgery(ies) itself, as well as various post-surgical procedures, surgical complications, infections or other medical complications, related illnesses, or related treatments that delay a person's attainment of maximum benefit from surgery.\n7.\nExacerbation:\nFor the purposes of these listings, exacerbation means an increase in the signs or symptoms of the skin disorder. Exacerbation may also be referred to as flare, flare-up, or worsening of the skin disorder.\nBack to Top\nC.\nWhat evidence do we need to evaluate your skin disorder?\n1. To establish the presence of a skin disorder as a medically determinable impairment, we need objective medical evidence from an acceptable medical source (AMS) who has examined you for the disorder.\n2. We will make every reasonable effort to obtain your medical history, treatment records, and relevant laboratory findings, but we will not purchase genetic testing.\n3. When we evaluate the presence and severity of your skin disorder(s), we generally need information regarding:\na. The onset, duration, and frequency of exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n);\nb. The prognosis of your skin disorder;\nc. The location, size, and appearance of lesions and contractures;\nd. Any available history of familial incidence;\ne. Your exposure to toxins, allergens or irritants; seasonal variations; and stress factors;\nf. Your ability to function outside of a highly protective environment (see\n8.00E4\n);\ng. Laboratory findings (for example, a biopsy obtained independently of Social Security disability evaluation or results of blood tests);\nh. Evidence from other medically acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice; and\ni. Statements you or others make about your disorder(s), your restrictions, and your daily activities.\nBack to Top\nD.\nHow do we evaluate the severity of skin disorders?\n1.\nGeneral.\nWe evaluate the severity of skin disorders based on the site(s) of your chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n),\n                     functional limitations caused by your signs and symptoms (including pain) (see\n8.00D2\n),\n                     and how your prescribed treatment affects you. We consider the frequency and severity of your exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n),\n                     how quickly they resolve, and how you function between exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n),\n                     to determine whether your skin disorder meets or medically equals a listing (see\n8.00D3\n).\n                     If there is no record of ongoing medical treatment for your disorder, we will follow the guidelines in\n8.00D6\n.\n                     We will determine the extent and kinds of evidence we need from medical and non-medical sources based on the individual facts about your disorder.\n                     For our basic rules on evidence, see §§\n404.1512\n,\n404.1513\n,\n404.1520b\n,\n416.912\n,\n416.913\n, \n                     and\n416.920b\nof this chapter.\n                     For our rules on evaluating your symptoms,\n                     see  §§\n404.1529\nand\n416.929\nof this chapter.\n2.\nLimitation(s) of physical functioning due to skin disorders.\na. Skin disorders may be due to chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n) or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n),\n                     and may cause pain or restrict movement, which can limit your ability to initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities.\n                     For example, skin lesions in the axilla may limit your ability to raise or reach with the affected arm, or lesions in the inguinal region may limit your ability to ambulate, sit, or lift and carry.\n                     To evaluate your skin disorder(s) under\n8.07B\n,\n8.08\n,\n                     and\n8.09\n,\n                     we require medically documented evidence of physical limitation(s) of functioning related to your disorder.\n                     The decrease in physical function must have lasted, or can be expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 months\n                     (see §§\n404.1509\nand\n416.909\nof this chapter).\n                     Xeroderma pigmentosum is the only skin disorder that does not include functional criteria because the characteristics\n                     and severity of the disorder itself are sufficient to meet the criteria in\n8.07A\n.\nb. The functional criteria require impairment-related physical limitations in using upper or lower extremities that have lasted, or can be expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 months, medically documented by one of the following:\ni. Inability to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities involving fine and gross movements\n                     (see\n8.00B5\n) due to chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n); or\nii. Inability to use one upper extremity to independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities involving fine and gross movements\n                     (see\n8.00B5\n) due to chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n), and a documented medical need (see\n8.00B4\n) for an assistive device\n                     (see\n8.00B1\n) that requires the use of the other upper extremity; or\niii. Inability to stand up from a seated position and maintain an upright position to the extent needed to independently initiate, sustain,\n                     and complete work-related activities due to chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n) or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n)\n                     affecting at least two extremities (including when the limitations are due to involvement of the perineum or the inguinal region); or\niv. Inability to maintain an upright position while standing or walking to the extent needed to independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities due to chronic skin lesions\n                     (see\n8.00B2\n) or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n) affecting both lower extremities\n                     (including when the limitations are due to involvement of the perineum or the inguinal region).\n3.\nFrequency of exacerbations due to chronic skin lesions.\nA skin disorder resulting in chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n) may have frequent exacerbations\n                     (see\n8.00B7\n) severe enough to meet a listing even if each individual skin lesion exacerbation\n                     (see\n8.00B7\n) did not last for an extended amount of time. We will consider the frequency, severity,\n                     and duration of skin lesion exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n), how quickly they resolve,\n                     and how you function in the time between skin lesion exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n),\n                     to determine whether your skin disorder meets or medically equals a listing.\n4.\nSymptoms (including pain).\nYour symptoms may be an important factor in our determination of whether your skin disorder(s) meets or medically equals a listing, or whether you are otherwise able to work.\n                     We consider your symptoms only when you have a medically determinable impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the symptoms.\n                     See §§\n404.1529\nand\n416.929\nof this chapter.\n5.\nTreatment.\na.\nGeneral.\nTreatments for skin disorders may have beneficial or adverse effects, and responses to treatment vary from person to person. Your skin disorder's response to treatment may vary due to treatment resistance or side effects that can result in functional limitations. We will evaluate all of the effects of treatment (including surgical treatment, medications, and therapy) on the symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of your skin disorder, and on your ability to function.\nb.\nDespite adherence to prescribed medical treatment for 3 months.\nUnder\n8.09\n, we require that your symptoms persist \"despite adherence to prescribed medical treatment for 3 months.\"\n                     This requirement means that you must have taken prescribed medication(s) or followed other medical treatment prescribed by a medical source for 3 consecutive months.\n                     Treatment or effects of treatment may be temporary. In most cases, sufficient time must elapse to allow us to evaluate your response to treatment,\n                     including any side effects. For our purposes, \"sufficient time\" means a period of at least 3 months.\n                     If your treatment has not lasted for at least 3 months, we will follow the rules in\n8.00D6a\n.\n                     The 3 months adherence to prescribed medical treatment must be within the period of at least 12 months that we use to evaluate severity.\nc.\nTreatment with PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A (UVA) light) or biologics.\nIf you receive additional treatment with PUVA or biologics to treat your skin disorder(s), we will defer adjudication of your claim for 6 months from the start of treatment with PUVA or biologics to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments unless we can make a fully favorable determination or decision on another basis.\n6.\nNo record of ongoing treatment.\na. Despite having a skin disorder, you may not have received ongoing treatment, may have just begun treatment, may not have access to prescribed medical treatment,\n                     or may not have an ongoing relationship with the medical community. In any of these situations, you will not have a longitudinal medical record for us to review when we evaluate your disorder.\n                     In some instances, we may be able to assess the severity and duration of your skin disorder based on your medical record and current evidence alone.\n                     We may ask you to attend a consultative examination to determine the severity and potential duration of your skin disorder\n                     (see §§\n404.1519a\nand\n416.919a\nof this chapter).\nb.  If, for any reason, you have not received treatment, your skin disorder cannot meet the criteria for\n8.09\n.\n                     If the information in your case record is not sufficient to show that you have a skin disorder that meets the criteria of one of the skin disorders listings,\n                     we will follow the rules in\n8.00I\n.\nE.\nHow do we evaluate genetic photosensitivity disorders under\n8.07\n?\nGenetic photosensitivity disorders are disorders of the skin caused by an increase in the sensitivity of the skin to sources of ultraviolet light, including sunlight.\n1.\nXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (\n8.07A\n).\nXP is a genetic photosensitivity disorder with lifelong hypersensitivity to all forms of ultraviolet light.\n                     Laboratory testing confirms the diagnosis by documenting abnormalities in the body's ability to repair DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations after ultraviolet light exposure.\n                     Your skin disorder meets the requirements of\n8.07A\nif you have clinical and laboratory findings supporting a diagnosis of XP\n                     (see\n8.00E3\n).\n2.\nOther genetic photosensitivity disorders (\n8.07B\n).\nThe effects of other genetic photosensitivity disorders may vary and may not persist over time.\n                     To meet the requirements of\n8.07B\n, a genetic photosensitivity disorder other than XP must be established by clinical and laboratory findings\n                     (see\n8.00C\n) and must result either in chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n) that result in functional limitations (see\n8.00D2\n),\n                     or must result in the inability to function outside of a highly protective environment (see\n8.00E4\n).\n                     Some genetic photosensitivity disorders can have very serious effects on other body systems, especially special senses and speech, neurological, mental, and cancer.\n                     We will evaluate your disorder(s) under the listings in\n2.00\n,\n11.00\n,\n12.00\n,\n                     or\n13.00\n, as appropriate.\n3.\nWhat evidence do we need to document that you have XP or another genetic photosensitivity disorder?\nWe will make a reasonable effort to obtain evidence of your disorder(s), but we will not purchase genetic testing. When the results of genetic tests are part of the existing evidence in your case record, we will evaluate the test results with all other relevant evidence. We need the following clinical and laboratory findings to document that you have XP or another genetic photosensitivity disorder:\na. A laboratory report of a definitive genetic test documenting appropriate chromosomal changes, including abnormal DNA repair or another DNA abnormality specific to your type of photosensitivity disorder, signed by an AMS; or\nb. A laboratory report of a definitive test that is not signed by an AMS, and a report from an AMS stating that you have undergone definitive genetic laboratory studies documenting appropriate chromosomal changes, including abnormal DNA repair or another DNA abnormality specific to your type of photosensitivity disorder; or\nc. If we do not have a laboratory report of a definitive test, we need documentation from an AMS that an appropriate laboratory analysis or other diagnostic method(s) confirms a positive diagnosis of your skin disorder. This documentation must state that you had the appropriate definitive laboratory test(s) for diagnosing your disorder and provide the results, or explain how another diagnostic method(s), consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice, established your diagnosis.\n4.\nInability to function outside of a highly protective environment\nmeans that you must avoid exposure to ultraviolet light (including sunlight passing through windows and light from similar unshielded light sources), wear protective clothing and eyeglasses, and use opaque broad-spectrum sunscreens in order to avoid skin cancer or other serious effects.\nF.\nHow do we evaluate burns under\n8.08\n?\n1. Electrical, chemical, or thermal burns frequently affect other body systems, for example, musculoskeletal, special senses and speech, respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary, neurological, or mental.\n                     We evaluate burns in the same way we evaluate other disorders that can affect the skin and other body systems, using the listing for the predominant feature of your disorder.\n                     For example, if your soft tissue injuries resulting from burns are under surgical management (as defined in\n8.00B6\n),\n                     we will evaluate your disorder under the listings in\n1.00\n.\n2. We evaluate burns resulting in chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n) that have been documented by an AMS to have reached maximum therapeutic benefit and therefore are no longer receiving surgical management,\n                     under\n8.08\n. To be disabling, these burns must result in functional limitation(s)\n                     (see\n8.00D2\n) that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\nG.\nHow do we evaluate chronic conditions of the skin or mucous membranes under\n8.09\n?\nWe evaluate skin disorders that result in chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n) under\n8.09\n.\n                     These disorders must result in chronic skin lesions (see\n8.00B2\n)\n                     or contractures (see\n8.00B3\n) that continue to persist despite adherence to prescribed medical treatment for 3 months\n                     (see\n8.00D5b\n) and cause functional limitations (see\n8.00D2\n).\n                     Examples of skin disorders evaluated under this listing are ichthyosis, bullous diseases (such as pemphigus, epidermolysis bullosa, and dermatitis herpetiformis),\n                     chronic skin infections, dermatitis, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.\nH.\nHow do we evaluate disorders in other body systems that affect the skin?\nWhen your disorder(s) in another body system affects your skin, we first evaluate the predominant feature of your disorder(s) under the appropriate body system. Examples of disorders in other body systems that may affect the skin include the following:\n1.\nDiabetes mellitus.\nDiabetes mellitus that is not well controlled, despite treatment, can cause chronic hyperglycemia resulting in serious, long-lasting or recurrent exacerbations\n                     (see\n8.00B7\n) or complications.\n                     We evaluate those exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n) or complications under the affected body system(s).\n                     If the complication involves soft tissue or amputation(s),\n                     we evaluate these features under the listings in\n1.00\n.\n                     If the exacerbations (see\n8.00B7\n) or complications involve chronic bacterial or fungal skin lesions resulting from diabetes mellitus,\n                     we evaluate your limitations from the skin disorder under listing\n8.09\n.\n2.\nTuberous sclerosis.\nThe predominant functionally limiting features of tuberous sclerosis are seizures and intellectual disorder or other mental disorders.\n                     We evaluate these features under the listings in\n11.00\nor\n12.00\n, as appropriate.\n3.\nMalignant tumors of the skin.\nMalignant tumors of the skin (for example, malignant melanomas) are cancers, or malignant neoplastic diseases,\n                     that we evaluate under the listings in\n13.00\n.\n4.\nImmune system disorders.\nWe evaluate skin manifestations of immune system disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, psoriasis,\n                     and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection under the listings in\n14.00\n.\n5.\nHead or facial disfigurement or deformity, and other physical deformities caused by skin disorders.\nA head or facial disfigurement or deformity may result in loss of your sight, hearing, speech, or ability to chew. In addition to head and facial disfigurement and deformity,\n                     other physical deformities may result in associated psychological problems (for example, depression). We evaluate the effects of head or facial disfigurement or deformity,\n                     or other physical deformities caused by skin disorders under the listings in\n1.00\n,\n2.00\n,\n5.00\n,\n                     or\n12.00\n, as appropriate.\nI.\nHow do we evaluate skin disorders that do not meet one of these listings?\n1. These listings are only examples of common skin disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity. If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have an impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another body system.\n2. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n                     See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.\n                     If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity.\n                     We proceed to the fourth step and, if necessary,\n                     the fifth step of the sequential evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter.\n                     We use the rules in  §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter,\n                     as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

    "full_text": "9.00 Endocrine Disorders - Adult\nSection 9.00 Endocrine Disorders\nA.\nWhat is an endocrine disorder?\nAn endocrine disorder is a medical condition that causes a hormonal imbalance.   \n                When an endocrine gland functions abnormally, producing either too much  of a specific hormone (hyperfunction) or too little (hypofunction), the hormonal imbalance can cause various complications in the body.  \n                The major glands of the endocrine system are the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pancreas.\nB.\nHow do we evaluate the effects of endocrine disorders?\nWe  evaluate impairments that result from endocrine disorders under the listings for other body systems.  For example:\n1.\nPituitary gland disorders\ncan disrupt hormone production and normal functioning in other endocrine glands and in many body systems.  \n                The effects of pituitary gland disorders vary depending on which hormones are involved.  For example, when pituitary hypofunction affects water and electrolyte balance in the kidney and leads to diabetes insipidus, \n                we evaluate the effects of recurrent dehydration under\n6.00\n.\n2.\nThyroid gland disorders\naffect the sympathetic nervous system and normal metabolism.  \n                We evaluate thyroid-related changes in blood pressure and heart rate that cause arrhythmias or other cardiac dysfunction under\n4.00\n; \n                thyroid-related weight loss under\n5.00\n; \n                hypertensive cerebrovascular accidents (strokes) under\n11.00\n; \n                and cognitive limitations, mood disorders, and anxiety under\n12.00\n.\n3.\nParathyroid gland disorders\naffect calcium levels in bone, blood, nerves, muscle, and other body  tissues.  \n                We evaluate parathyroid-related osteoporosis and fractures under\n1.00\n; \n                abnormally elevated calcium levels in  the blood (hypercalcemia) that lead to cataracts under\n2.00\n; \n                kidney failure under\n6.00\n; \n                and recurrent abnormally low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) that lead to increased excitability of nerves and muscles, such as tetany and muscle spasms, \n                under\n11.00\n.\n4.\nAdrenal gland disorders\naffect bone calcium levels, blood pressure, metabolism, and mental status.  \n                We evaluate adrenal-related osteoporosis with fractures that compromises the ability to walk or to use the upper extremities under\n1.00\n;\n    adrenal-related hypertension that worsens heart failure or causes recurrent arrhythmias under\n4.00\n; \n    adrenal-related weight loss under\n5.00\n; \n    and mood disorders under\n12.00\n.\n5.\nDiabetes mellitus and other  pancreatic gland disorders\ndisrupt the production of several hormones, including insulin, that regulate metabolism and digestion.\n                  Insulin is essential to the absorption of glucose from the bloodstream into body cells for conversion into cellular energy.  The most common pancreatic gland  disorder is\ndiabetes mellitus\n(DM).  \n                There are two major types of DM:  type 1 and type 2.  Both type 1 and type 2 DM are chronic disorders that can have serious disabling  complications that meet the duration requirement.  \n                Type 1 DM--previously known as “juvenile  diabetes” or “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus” \n                (IDDM)--is an absolute  deficiency of insulin production that commonly begins in childhood and continues throughout adulthood.   Treatment of type 1 DM always requires lifelong daily insulin. \n                 With type 2 DM--previously known as  “adult-onset diabetes mellitus” or “non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus”  (NIDDM)--the body’s cells resist the effects of insulin, \n                impairing glucose absorption and metabolism.  Treatment of  type 2 DM generally requires lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and dietary modification, \n                and sometimes insulin in addition to other medications.  While both type 1 and type 2 DM are usually  controlled, some persons do not achieve good control for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, \n                hypoglycemia unawareness, other disorders that  can affect blood glucose levels, inability to manage DM due to a mental  disorder, or inadequate treatment.\na.\nHyperglycemia.\nBoth types of DM cause hyperglycemia, which is an abnormally high level of blood glucose that may produce acute and long-term complications.\n                  Acute complications of hyperglycemia include diabetic ketoacidosis.  Long-term complications of chronic hyperglycemia include many conditions affecting various body systems.\n(i)\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).\nDKA is an acute, potentially life-threatening complication of DM in which the chemical balance of the body becomes dangerously hyperglycemic and acidic.  \n                It results from a severe insulin deficiency, which  can occur due to missed or inadequate daily insulin therapy or in association  with an acute illness.  \n                It usually requires hospital treatment to correct the acute complications of dehydration,  electrolyte imbalance, and insulin deficiency.   \n                You may have serious complications resulting from your treatment, which  we evaluate under the affected body system.   \n                For example, we evaluate cardiac arrhythmias under\n4.00\n, \n                intestinal necrosis under\n5.00\n, \n                and cerebral edema and seizures under\n11.00\n.  \n                Recurrent episodes of DKA may result from mood or eating disorders, which we evaluate under\n12.00\n.\n(ii)\nChronic hyperglycemia.\nChronic hyperglycemia, which is longstanding  abnormally high levels of blood glucose, \n                leads to long-term diabetic complications by disrupting nerve and blood vessel functioning.  This disruption can have many different  effects in other body systems.  \n                For example, we evaluate diabetic peripheral neurovascular disease that leads to gangrene and subsequent amputation of an extremity under\n1.00\n; \n                diabetic retinopathy under\n2.00\n; \n                coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease under\n4.00\n; \n                diabetic gastroparesis that results in abnormal gastrointestinal motility under\n5.00\n; \n                diabetic nephropathy under\n6.00\n; \n                poorly healing bacterial and fungal skin  infections under\n8.00\n; \n                diabetic peripheral and sensory neuropathies under\n11.00\n; \n                and cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety under\n12.00\n.\nb.\nHypoglycemia.\nPersons with DM may experience episodes of hypoglycemia, which is an abnormally low level of blood glucose.  \n                Most adults recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia and reverse them by consuming substances containing glucose; however, some do not take this step because of hypoglycemia unawareness.  \n                Severe hypoglycemia can lead to complications, including seizures or loss of consciousness, \n                which we evaluate under\n11.00\n, \n                or altered mental status and cognitive deficits, which we evaluate under\n12.00\n.\nC.\nHow do we evaluate endocrine disorders that do not have effects that meet or medically equal the criteria of any listing in other body systems?\nIf your impairment(s) does not meet or  medically equal a listing in another body system, you may or may not have the  residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity.  \n                In this situation, we proceed to the fourth  and, if necessary, \n                the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\n.  \n                When we decide whether you continue to be disabled, we use the rules in §§\n404.1594\n,\n416.994\n, \n                and\n416.994a\n.",

    "full_text": "10.00 Congenital Disorders that Affect Multiple Body Systems\nA.\nWhich disorder do we evaluate under this body system\n?\nAlthough Down syndrome exists in non-mosaic and mosaic forms, we evaluate only  non-mosaic Down syndrome under this body system.\nB.\nWhat is non-mosaic Down syndrome?\nNon-mosaic Down syndrome is a genetic disorder. \n                Most people with non-mosaic Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 in all of their cells (chromosome 21 trisomy); \n                some have an extra copy of chromosome 21 attached to a  different chromosome in all of their cells (chromosome 21 translocation).  \n                Virtually all people with non-mosaic Down syndrome have characteristic facial or other physical features, delayed physical development, and intellectual disability. \n                People with non-mosaic Down syndrome may also have congenital heart disease, impaired vision, hearing problems, and other disorders. \n                We evaluate non-mosaic Down syndrome under\n10.06\n.\n    If you have non-mosaic Down syndrome documented as described in\n10.00C\n, we consider you disabled from birth.\nC.\nWhat evidence do we need to document non-mosaic Down syndrome under\n10.06\n?\n1. Under 10.06A, we will find you disabled based on laboratory findings.\na. To find that your disorder meets\n10.06A\n,\n    we need a copy of the laboratory report of karyotype analysis, which is the definitive test to establish non-mosaic Down syndrome. We will not purchase karyotype analysis.\n    We will not accept a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test because it does not distinguish between the mosaic and non-mosaic forms of Down syndrome.\nb. If a physician (see §§\n404.1513(a)(1)\nand\n416.913(a)(1)\nof this chapter) \n                has not signed the laboratory report of karyotype analysis, the evidence must also include a physician’s statement that you have Down syndrome.\nc. For purposes of\n10.06A\n, \n                we do not require additional evidence stating that you have the distinctive facial or other physical features of Down syndrome.\n2. If we do not have a laboratory report of  karyotype analysis showing that you have non-mosaic Down syndrome, \n                we may find you disabled under\n10.06B\nor\n10.06C\n.\na. Under\n10.06B\n, we need a physician’s report stating: \n                (i) your karyotype diagnosis or evidence that documents your type of Down syndrome is consistent with prior karyotype analysis (for example,  reference to a diagnosis of “trisomy 21”), \n                and (ii) that you have the distinctive facial or other physical features of Down syndrome. We do not require a detailed description of the facial or other physical features of the disorder. \n                However, we will not find that your disorder meets\n10.06B\nif we have evidence—such as evidence of functioning inconsistent with the diagnosis—that indicates that you do not have non-mosaic Down syndrome.\nb. If we do not have evidence of prior karyotype analysis (you did not have testing, or you had testing but we do not have information from a physician about the test results), \n                we will find that your disorder meets\n10.06C\nif we have: \n                (i) a physician’s report stating that you have the distinctive facial or other physical features of Down syndrome,\n    and (ii) evidence that your functioning is consistent with a diagnosis of non-mosaic Down syndrome.\n    This evidence may include medical or nonmedical information about your physical and mental abilities, including information  about your education, work history, or the results of psychological testing.\n    However, we will not find that your disorder meets\n10.06C\nif we have evidence—such as evidence of functioning inconsistent with the diagnosis—that indicates that you do not have non-mosaic Down syndrome.\nD.\nHow do  we evaluate mosaic Down syndrome and other congenital disorders that affect  multiple body systems?\n1.\nMosaic Down  syndrome.\nApproximately 2 percent of people with Down syndrome have the  mosaic form. In mosaic Down syndrome, there are some cells with an extra copy  of chromosome 21 and other cells with the normal two copies of chromosome 21.  Mosaic Down syndrome can be so slight as to be undetected clinically, but it  can also be profound and disabling, affecting various body systems.\n2.\nOther  congenital disorders that affect multiple body systems.\nOther congenital  disorders, such as congenital anomalies, chromosomal disorders, dysmorphic  syndromes, inborn metabolic syndromes, and perinatal infectious diseases, can  cause deviation from, or interruption of, the normal function of the body or  can interfere with development. Examples of these disorders include both the  juvenile and late-onset forms of Tay-Sachs disease, trisomy X syndrome (XXX  syndrome), fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria (PKU), caudal regression  syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome. For these disorders and other disorders  like them, the degree of deviation, interruption, or interference, as well as  the resulting functional limitations and their progression, may vary widely  from person to person and may affect different body systems.\n3.\nEvaluating  the effects of mosaic Down syndrome or another congenital disorder under the  listings.\nWhen the effects of mosaic Down syndrome or another congenital  disorder that affects multiple body systems are sufficiently severe we evaluate the disorder under the appropriate affected body system(s), \n                such as musculoskeletal, special senses and speech, neurological, or mental disorders.  Otherwise, \n                we evaluate the specific functional limitations that result from the disorder under our other rules described in\n10.00E\n.\nE.\nWhat if your disorder does not meet a listing?\nIf you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will consider whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing. \n                See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter. \n                If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage  in substantial gainful activity. \n                We proceed to the fourth, and if necessary, the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in \n                §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter.\n    We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter, as  appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",

    "title": "Neurological",
    "body_system": "Neurological",
    "section_number": "11.00",
    "full_text": "11.00 Neurological\nA.\nWhich neurological  disorders do we evaluate under these listings?\nWe evaluate epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, coma or persistent vegetative state (PVS), and neurological disorders that cause disorganization of motor function, bulbar and neuromuscular dysfunction, \n          communication impairment, or a combination of  limitations in physical and mental functioning such as early-onset Alzheimer’s  disease. \n          We evaluate neurological disorders that may manifest in a combination of limitations in physical and mental functioning. For example, if you have a neurological disorder that causes mental limitations, \n          such as Huntington’s disease, which may limit executive functioning (e.g., regulating attention, planning, inhibiting responses, decision-making), \n          we evaluate your limitations using the functional criteria under these listings (see\n11.00G\n). Under this body system, \n          we evaluate the limitations resulting from the impact of the  neurological disease process itself. \n          If your neurological disorder results in only mental impairment or if you have a co-occurring mental condition that is not caused by  your neurological disorder (for example, dementia), \n          we will evaluate your  mental impairment under the mental disorders body system,\n12.00\n.\nB.\nWhat evidence do we need to document your neurological disorder?\nWe need both medical and non-medical evidence (signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings) to assess  the effects of your neurological disorder. Medical evidence should include your  medical history, examination findings, relevant laboratory tests, and the  results of imaging. Imaging refers to medical imaging techniques, such as  x-ray, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and  electroencephalography (EEG). The imaging must be consistent with the  prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice as the proper  technique to support the evaluation of the disorder. In addition, the medical  evidence may include descriptions of any prescribed treatment and your response  to it. We consider non-medical evidence such as statements you or others make  about your impairments, your restrictions, your daily activities, or your  efforts to work.\nWe will make every reasonable effort to obtain the results of your laboratory and imaging evidence. When the results of any of these tests are part of the existing evidence in your case record, we will evaluate the test results and all other relevant evidence. We will not  purchase imaging, or other diagnostic tests, or laboratory tests that are complex, may involve significant risk, or that  are invasive. We will not routinely purchase tests that are expensive or not  readily available.\nC.\nHow do we consider  adherence to prescribed treatment in neurological disorders?\nIn\n11.02\n(Epilepsy),\n11.06\n(Parkinsonian  syndrome), \n      and\n11.12\n(Myasthenia gravis), we require that limitations from  these neurological disorders exist despite adherence to prescribed treatment.  \n      “Despite adherence to prescribed treatment” means that you have taken medication(s) or followed other treatment procedures for your neurological disorder(s) \n      as prescribed by a physician for three consecutive months but your impairment  continues to meet the other listing requirements despite this treatment. \n      You  may receive your treatment at a health care facility that you visit regularly, even if you do not see the same physician on each visit.\nD.\nWhat do we mean by disorganization of motor function?\nDisorganization of motor function\nmeans interference, due to your neurological disorder, with movement of two extremities; i.e., the lower extremities, or upper extremities \n                    (including fingers, wrists, hands, arms, and shoulders). By two  extremities we mean both lower extremities, or both upper extremities, or one  upper extremity and one lower extremity. \n                    All listings in this body system,  except for\n11.02\n(Epilepsy),\n11.10\n(Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), \n                    and\n11.20\n(Coma and persistent vegetative state), include criteria for disorganization of motor function that results in an extreme limitation in your ability to:\nStand up from a seated position; or\nBalance while standing or walking; or\nUse the upper extremities (including fingers, wrists, hands, arms, and shoulders).\nExtreme limitation\nmeans the inability to stand up from a seated position, maintain balance in a  standing position and while walking, or use your upper extremities to  independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities. The  assessment of motor function depends on the degree of interference with standing  up; balancing while standing or walking; or using the upper extremities  (including fingers, hands, arms, and shoulders).\nInability to stand up from a seated position means that once seated you are unable to stand and maintain an upright position without the assistance of another person or the  use of an assistive device, such as a walker, two crutches, or two canes.\nInability to maintain balance in a standing position means that you are unable to maintain an upright position while standing or walking without the assistance of another person or  an assistive device, such as a walker, two crutches, or two canes.\nInability to use your upper extremities means that you have a loss of function of both upper extremities (including fingers, wrists, hands, arms, and shoulders) that very seriously limits your ability to independently initiate, sustain, and complete  work-related activities involving fine and gross motor movements. Inability to  perform fine and gross motor movements could include not being able to pinch,  manipulate, and use your fingers; or not being able to use your hands, arms,  and shoulders to perform gross motor movements, such as handling, gripping,  grasping, holding, turning, and reaching; or not being able to engage in  exertional movements such a lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling.\nE.\nHow do we evaluate communication impairments under these listings?\nWe must have a description of a recent comprehensive evaluation including all areas of communication, performed by an acceptable medical source, \n            to document a communication impairment associated  with a neurological disorder. \n            A communication impairment may occur when a medically determinable neurological impairment results in dysfunction in the  parts of the brain responsible for speech and language. \n            We evaluate communication impairments associated with neurological disorders under\n11.04A\n,\n11.07C\n, \n            or\n11.11B\n. \n            We evaluate communication impairments due to  non-neurological disorders under\n2.09\n.\nUnder\n11.04A\n, we need evidence documenting that your central nervous system vascular accident or insult (CVA) \n                  and sensory or motor aphasia have resulted in ineffective speech or communication.\nIneffective speech or communication\nmeans there is an extreme limitation in your ability to understand or convey your message in simple spoken language resulting in your inability to demonstrate basic \n                  communication skills, such as following one-step commands or telling someone about your basic personal needs without assistance.\nUnder\n11.07C\n, we need evidence documenting that your cerebral palsy has resulted in significant interference in your ability to speak, hear, or see. \n                  We will find  you have “significant interference” in your ability to speak, hear, or see if  your signs, such as aphasia, strabismus, or sensorineural hearing loss, \n                  seriously limit your ability to communicate on a sustained basis.\nUnder\n11.11B\n, we need evidence documenting that your post-polio syndrome has resulted in the inability to produce intelligible speech.\nF.\nWhat do we mean by bulbar and neuromuscular dysfunction?\nThe bulbar region of the brain is responsible for controlling the bulbar muscles in the throat, tongue, \n      jaw, and face. Bulbar and neuromuscular dysfunction refers to weakness in these muscles, resulting in breathing, swallowing, and speaking impairments. \n    Listings\n11.11\n(Post-polio syndrome),\n11.12\n(Myasthenia gravis), \n      and\n11.22\n(Motor neuron disorders other than ALS) include criteria for evaluating bulbar and neuromuscular dysfunction. \n      If your neurological disorder has resulted in a breathing disorder, we may evaluate  that condition under the respiratory system,\n3.00\n.\nG.\nHow do we evaluate limitations in physical and mental functioning under these listings?\nNeurological disorders may manifest in a combination of limitations in physical and mental functioning.\n              We consider all relevant information in your case record to determine the effects of your neurological disorder on your physical and mental functioning.\n              To satisfy the requirement described under 11.00G, your neurological  disorder must result in a marked limitation in physical functioning and a  marked limitation in at least one of four areas of mental functioning:\n              understanding, remembering, or applying information; interacting with others;  concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace; or adapting or managing oneself.\n              If your neurological disorder results in an extreme limitation in at least one of the four areas of mental functioning, or results in marked limitation in at least two of the four areas of mental functioning,\n              but you do  not have at least a marked limitation in your physical functioning, we will  consider whether your condition meets or medically equals one of the mental disorders body system listings,\n12.00\n.\nMarked Limitation\n. To satisfy the requirements of the functional criteria, \n          your neurological disorder must result in a marked limitation in physical functioning and a marked limitation in one of the four areas of mental functioning \n          (see\n11.00G3\n). Although  we do not require the use of such a scale, \"marked\" would be the  fourth point on a five-point scale consisting of no limitation, mild limitation, moderate limitation,\n    marked limitation, and extreme limitation. We  consider the nature and overall degree of interference with your functioning.\n    The term \"marked\" does not require that you must be confined to bed, hospitalized, or in a nursing home.\nMarked limitation and physical functioning\n. For this criterion, a marked limitation means that, due to the signs and symptoms of your neurological disorder, \n                you are seriously limited in the ability to independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related physical activities (see\n11.00G3\n).\n    You may have a marked limitation in your physical  functioning when your neurological disease process causes persistent or  intermittent symptoms that affect your abilities to independently initiate,  sustain, and complete work-related activities, such as standing, balancing,  walking, using both upper extremities for fine and gross movements, or results  in limitations in using one upper and one lower extremity. The persistent and  intermittent symptoms must result in a serious limitation in your ability to do  a task or activity on a sustained basis. We do not define \"marked\" by a specific number of different  physical activities or tasks that demonstrate your ability, but by the overall  effects of your neurological symptoms on your ability to perform such physical  activities on a consistent and sustained basis. You need not be totally  precluded from performing a function or activity to have a marked limitation,  as long as the degree of limitation seriously limits your ability to  independently initiate, sustain, and complete work-related physical activities.\nMarked limitation and mental functioning\n.  For this criterion, a marked limitation means that, due to the signs and symptoms of your neurological disorder, \n              you are seriously limited in the ability to function  independently, appropriately, effectively, \n              and on a sustained basis in work settings (see\n11.03G3\n). We do  not define “marked” by a specific number of mental activities, such as: the  number of activities that demonstrate your ability to understand, remember, and  apply information; the number of tasks that demonstrate your ability to  interact with others; a specific number of tasks that demonstrate you are able  to concentrate, persist or maintain pace; or a specific number of tasks that  demonstrate you are able to manage yourself. You may have a marked limitation  in your mental functioning when several activities or functions are impaired,  or even when only one is impaired. You need not be totally precluded from  performing an activity to have a marked limitation, as long as the degree of  limitation seriously limits your ability to function independently,  appropriately, and effectively on a sustained basis, and complete work-related  mental activities.\nAreas of physical and mental functioning.\nPhysical functioning\n. Examples of this criterion include specific motor abilities, such as independently initiating, sustaining, and completing the following activities: \n              standing up from a seated position, balancing while standing or walking, \n              or using both your upper extremities for fine and gross movements (see\n11.00D\n). \n              Physical functioning may also include functions of the body that support motor abilities, such as the abilities to see, breathe, \n              and swallow (see\n11.00E\nand\n11.00F\n). \n              Examples of when your limitation in seeing, breathing, or swallowing may, on its own, rise to a “marked” limitation  include: prolonged and uncorrectable double vision causing difficulty with  balance; \n              prolonged difficulty breathing requiring the use of a prescribed assistive breathing device, such as a portable continuous positive airway pressure machine; or repeated instances, occurring at least weekly, \n              of aspiration without causing aspiration pneumonia. Alternatively, you may have a combination of limitations due to your neurological disorder that together rise to a “marked” limitation in physical functioning. \n              We may also find that you have a “marked” limitation in this area if, for example, your symptoms, such as pain or fatigue \n              (see\n11.00T\n), as documented in your medical record, and caused by your  neurological disorder or its treatment, \n              seriously limit your ability to independently initiate, sustain, and complete these work-related motor functions, or the other physical functions or physiological processes that support those motor functions. \n              We may also find you seriously limited in an area if, while you retain some ability to perform the function, you are unable to do so consistently and  on a sustained basis. \n              The limitation in your physical functioning must last or be expected to last at least 12 months. These examples illustrate the nature of physical functioning. We do not require documentation of all of the examples.\nMental functioning.\nUnderstanding, remembering, or applying information.\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the abilities  to learn, recall, and use information to perform work activities. Examples include: understanding and learning terms, instructions, procedures; following  one- or two-step oral instructions to carry out a task; describing work  activity to someone else; asking and answering questions and providing  explanations; recognizing a mistake and correcting it; identifying and solving  problems; sequencing multi-step activities; and using reason and judgment to  make work-related decisions. These examples illustrate the nature of this area  of mental functioning. We do not require documentation of all of the examples.\nInteracting with others.\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the abilities to relate to and work with supervisors, co-workers, and the public. Examples include: cooperating with others; asking  for help when needed; handling conflicts with others; stating your own point of  view; initiating or sustaining conversation; understanding and responding to  social cues (physical, verbal, emotional); responding to requests, suggestions,  criticism, correction, and challenges; and keeping social interactions free of  excessive irritability, sensitivity, argumentativeness, or suspiciousness.  These examples illustrate the nature of this area of mental functioning. We do  not require documentation of all of the examples.\nConcentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace.\nThis area of mental  functioning refers to the abilities to focus attention on work activities and to stay on-task at a sustained rate. Examples include: initiating and  performing a task that you understand and know how to do; working at an appropriate  and consistent pace; completing tasks in a timely manner; ignoring or avoiding  distractions while working; changing activities or work settings without being  disruptive; working close to or with others without interrupting or distracting  them; sustaining an ordinary routine and regular attendance at work; and  working a full day without needing more than the allotted number or length of  rest periods during the day. These examples illustrate the nature of this area  of mental functioning. We do not require documentation of all of the examples.\nAdapting or  managing oneself.\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the abilities to  regulate emotions, control behavior, and maintain well-being in a work  setting. Examples include: responding  to demands; adapting to changes; managing your psychologically based symptoms;  distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable work performance; setting  realistic goals; making plans for yourself independently of others; maintaining  personal hygiene and attire appropriate to a work setting; and being aware of  normal hazards and taking appropriate precautions. These examples  illustrate the nature of this area of mental functioning. We do not require  documentation of all of the examples.\nSigns and symptoms of your disorder and the effects of treatment.\nWe will consider your signs and symptoms and how they affect your ability to function in the work place. When we evaluate your functioning, we will consider whether your signs and symptoms are persistent or intermittent, how frequently they occur and how long they last, their intensity, and whether you have periods of exacerbation and remission.\nWe will consider the effectiveness of treatment in improving the signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings related to your neurological disorder, as well as any aspects of  treatment that may interfere with your ability to function. We will consider,  for example: the effects of medications you take (including side effects); the  time-limited efficacy of some medications; the intrusiveness, complexity, and  duration of your treatment (for example, the dosing schedule or need for  injections); the effects of treatment, including medications, therapy, and  surgery, on your functioning; the variability of your response to treatment;  and any drug interactions.\nH.\nWhat is epilepsy, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.02\n?\nEpilepsy\nis a pattern of recurrent and unprovoked seizures that are manifestations of  abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There are various types of generalized and “focal” or partial seizures. \n            However, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and pseudoseizures are not epileptic seizures for the purpose of\n11.02\n. \n          We evaluate psychogenic seizures and pseudoseizures under the mental disorders body system,\n12.00\n. \n          In adults, the most common potentially disabling seizure types are\ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures\nand\ndyscognitive seizures\n(formerly complex partial seizures).\nGeneralized tonic-clonic seizures\nare characterized by loss of consciousness accompanied by a tonic phase (sudden muscle tensing causing the person to lose postural control) followed by a clonic phase (rapid cycles of muscle  contraction and relaxation, also called convulsions). Tongue biting and  incontinence may occur during generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and injuries  may result from falling.\nDyscognitive seizures\nare characterized by alteration of consciousness without convulsions or loss of muscle control. During the seizure, blank staring, change of facial expression, \n                    and automatisms (such as lip smacking,  chewing or swallowing, or repetitive simple actions, such as gestures or verbal  utterances) may occur. During its course, \n                    a dyscognitive seizure may progress into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (see\n11.00H1a\n).\nDescription of seizure.\nWe require at least one detailed description of your seizures from someone, preferably a medical professional, who has observed at least one of your typical seizures. If you  experience more than one type of seizure, we require a description of each  type.\nSerum drug levels.\nWe do not require serum drug levels; therefore,  we will not purchase them. However, if serum drug levels are available in your  medical records, we will evaluate them in the context of the other evidence in  your case record.\nCounting seizures.\nThe period specified in\n11.02A\n,\nB\n, \n          or\nC\ncannot begin earlier than one month after you began prescribed treatment.\n    The required number of seizures must occur within the period we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disability review. When we evaluate the frequency of your seizures,\n    we also consider your adherence to  prescribed treatment (see\n11.00C\n). When we determine the number of seizures you  have had in the specified period, we will:\nCount multiple seizures occurring in a 24-hour period as one seizure.\nCount status epilepticus (a continuous series of seizures without return to consciousness  between seizures) as one seizure.\nCount a dyscognitive  seizure that progresses into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure as one  generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\nWe do not count seizures that occur during a period when you are not adhering to prescribed treatment without good reason.  \n              When we determine that you had good reason for not adhering to prescribed  treatment, we will consider your physical, mental, educational, and communicative limitations (including any language barriers). \n              We will consider you to have good reason for not following prescribed treatment if, for example, the treatment is very risky for you due to its consequences or unusual nature, \n              or if you are unable to afford prescribed treatment that you are willing to accept, but for which no free community resources are available. \n              We will follow  guidelines found in our policy, such as §§\n404.1530(c)\nand\n416.930(c)\nof this chapter,\n    when we determine whether you have a good reason for not adhering to prescribed treatment.\nWe do not count psychogenic nonepileptic seizures or pseudoseizures under\n11.02\n. \n              We evaluate these seizures under the mental disorders body system,\n12.00\n.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) testing.\nWe do not require EEG test results; therefore, we will not purchase them. However, if EEG test results are available in your medical records, we will evaluate them in the  context of the other evidence in your case record.\nI.\nWhat is vascular insult to the brain, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.04\n?\nVascular insult to the brain\n(cerebrum, cerebellum, or  brainstem), commonly referred to as stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), \n          is brain cell death caused by an interruption of blood flow within or leading  to the brain, or by a hemorrhage from a ruptured blood vessel or aneurysm in the brain. \n          If you have a vision impairment resulting from your vascular insult, we may evaluate that impairment  under the special senses body system,\n2.00\n.\nWe need evidence of sensory or motor aphasia that results in ineffective speech or communication under\n11.04A\n(see\n11.00E\n).\n    We may evaluate your communication impairment under listing\n11.04C\nif you have marked limitation in physical functioning and marked limitation in one of the four areas of mental functioning.\nWe generally need evidence from at least 3 months after the vascular insult to evaluate whether you have disorganization of motor functioning under\n11.04B\n, \n          or the impact that your disorder has on your physical and mental functioning under\n11.04C\n. \n          In some cases, evidence of your vascular insult is sufficient to allow your claim within 3 months post-vascular insult. If we are unable to allow your claim within 3 months after your vascular insult, \n          we will defer adjudication of the claim until we obtain evidence of your neurological disorder at least 3 months post-vascular insult.\nJ.\nWhat are benign  brain tumors, and how do we evaluate them under\n11.05\n?\nBenign brain tumors are noncancerous (nonmalignant) abnormal growths of tissue in or on the brain  that invade healthy brain tissue or apply pressure on the brain or cranial nerves. \n          We evaluate their effects on your functioning as discussed in\n11.00D\nand\n11.00G\n.\n          We evaluate malignant brain tumors under the cancer body system in\n13.00\n.\n    If you have a vision impairment resulting from your benign brain tumor, we may evaluate that impairment under the special senses body system,\n2.00\n.\nK.\nWhat is Parkinsonian syndrome, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.06\n?\nParkinsonian syndrome is a term that describes a group of chronic, progressive  movement disorders resulting from loss or decline in the function of dopamine-producing brain cells. \n      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates  muscle movement throughout the body. When we evaluate your Parkinsonian syndrome, \n      we will consider your adherence to prescribed treatment (see\n11.00C\n).\nL.\nWhat is cerebral palsy, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.07\n?\nCerebral palsy (CP)\nis a term that describes a group of static, \n          nonprogressive disorders caused by abnormalities within the brain that disrupt the brain's ability to control movement, muscle coordination, and posture. \n          The resulting motor deficits manifest very early in a person’s development, with delayed or abnormal progress in attaining developmental milestones. \n          Deficits may become more obvious as the person grows and matures over time.\nWe evaluate your signs and symptoms, such as ataxia, spasticity, flaccidity, athetosis, chorea,  and difficulty with precise movements when we determine your ability to stand  up, balance, walk, or perform fine and gross motor movements. We will also  evaluate your signs, such as dysarthria and apraxia of speech, and receptive and  expressive language problems when we determine your ability to communicate.\nWe will consider your other impairments or signs and symptoms that develop  secondary to the disorder, such as post-impairment syndrome (a combination of  pain, fatigue, and weakness due to muscle abnormalities); overuse syndromes  (repetitive motion injuries); arthritis; abnormalities of proprioception  (perception of the movements and position of the body); abnormalities of  stereognosis (perception and identification of objects by touch); learning  problems; anxiety; and depression.\nM.\nWhat are spinal cord disorders, and how do we evaluate them under\n11.08\n?\nSpinal cord disorders\nmay be congenital or caused by injury to the  spinal cord. Motor signs and symptoms of spinal cord disorders include paralysis, flaccidity, spasticity, \n          and weakness.\nSpinal cord disorders with complete loss of function\n(\n11.08A\n) addresses spinal cord disorders that result in a complete lack of motor, sensory,\n    and autonomic function of the affected part(s) of the body.\nSpinal cord disorders with disorganization of motor function\n(\n11.08B\n) \n          addresses spinal cord disorders that result in less than a  complete loss of function of the affected part(s) of the body, reducing, but not eliminating, motor, sensory, and autonomic function.\nWhen we evaluate your spinal cord disorder, we generally need evidence from at least 3 months after your symptoms began in order to evaluate your disorganization of motor function. \n          In some cases, evidence of your spinal cord disorder may be sufficient to allow your claim within 3 months after the spinal cord disorder. \n          If the medical evidence demonstrates total cord transection causing a loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of injury, we will not wait 3 months but will make the allowance decision immediately.\nN.\nWhat is multiple sclerosis, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.09\n?\nMultiple sclerosis (MS)\nis a chronic, inflammatory, degenerative  disorder that damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve fibers in the  brain and spinal cord. \n          The damage disrupts the normal transmission of nerve impulses within  the brain and between the brain and other parts of the body, causing impairment  in muscle coordination, strength, balance, sensation, and vision. \n          There are  several forms of MS, ranging from mildly to highly aggressive. Milder forms  generally involve acute attacks (exacerbations) with partial or complete  recovery from signs and symptoms (remissions). \n          Aggressive forms generally  exhibit a steady progression of signs and symptoms with few or no remissions.  The effects of all forms vary from person to person.\nWe evaluate your signs and symptoms, such as flaccidity, spasticity, spasms, incoordination, imbalance, tremor, physical fatigue, muscle weakness, dizziness, tingling, \n          and numbness when we determine your ability to stand up, balance, walk, or perform  fine and gross motor movements. When determining whether you have limitations of physical and mental functioning, \n          we will consider your other impairments or signs and symptoms that develop secondary to the disorder, such as fatigue; visual loss; trouble sleeping; impaired attention, concentration, memory, or judgment; mood swings; \n          and depression. If you have a vision impairment resulting from your MS, we may evaluate that impairment under the special senses body system,\n2.00\n.\nO.\nWhat is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.10\n?\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\nis a type of motor neuron disorder that rapidly and progressively attacks the  nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. We establish ALS under\n11.10\nwhen you have a documented diagnosis of ALS. \n      We require documentation based on generally accepted methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\n      We require laboratory testing to establish the diagnosis when the clinical findings of  upper and lower motor neuron disease are not present in three or more regions.  \n      Electrophysiological studies, such as nerve conduction velocity studies and electromyography (EMG), may support your diagnosis of ALS; however, we will  not purchase these studies.\nP.\nWhat are neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, such as Huntington’s disease, Friedreich’s ataxia, and spinocerebellar degeneration, \n          and how do we evaluate them under\n11.17\n?\nNeurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system are disorders characterized by progressive and irreversible degeneration of neurons or their supporting cells. \n      Over time, these disorders impair many of the body's motor, cognitive, and other mental  functions. \n      We consider neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system under\n11.17\nthat we do not evaluate elsewhere in section\n11.00\n, such as Huntington’s disease (HD), Friedreich’s ataxia, spinocerebellar degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), \n      early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia (Pick’s disease).  When these disorders result in solely cognitive and other mental function effects, \n      we will evaluate the disorder under the mental disorder listings.\nQ.\nWhat is traumatic brain injury, and how do we evaluate it under\n11.18\n?\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI)\nis damage to the  brain resulting from skull fracture, collision with an external force leading  to a closed head injury, \n          or penetration by an object that enters the skull and  makes contact with brain tissue. \n          We evaluate TBI that results in coma or persistent vegetative state (PVS) under\n11.20\n.\nWe generally need evidence from at least 3 months after the TBI to evaluate whether you have disorganization of motor function under\n11.18A\nor the impact that your disorder has on your physical and mental functioning under\n11.18B\n. In some cases, evidence of your TBI is sufficient to determine disability within 3 months post-TBI. \n          If we are unable to allow your claim within 3 months post-TBI, we  will defer adjudication of the claim until we obtain evidence of your  neurological disorder at least 3 months post-TBI. If a finding of disability  still is not possible at that time, we will again defer adjudication of the  claim until we obtain evidence at least 6 months after your TBI.\nR.\nWhat are coma and persistent vegetative state, and how do we evaluate them under\n11.20\n?\nComa is a state of unconsciousness in which a person does not  exhibit a sleep/wake cycle, and is unable to perceive or respond to external stimuli. \n      People who do not fully emerge from coma may progress into a persistent vegetative state (PVS). \n      PVS is a condition of partial arousal in which a person may have a low level of consciousness but is still unable to react to external stimuli. \n      In contrast to coma, a person in a PVS retains  sleep/wake cycles and may exhibit some key lower brain functions, such as  spontaneous movement, opening and moving eyes, and grimacing. \n      Coma or PVS may  result from TBI, a nontraumatic insult to the brain (such as a vascular insult,  infection, or brain tumor), or a neurodegenerative or metabolic disorder.  \n      Medically induced comas are not considered under\n11.20\nand \n      should be considered under the section pertaining to the underlying reason the coma was medically induced and not under this section.\nS.\nWhat are motor neuron disorders, other than ALS, and how do we evaluate them under\n11.22\n?\nMotor neuron disorders such as progressive bulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are progressive neurological disorders that destroy the cells that control voluntary muscle activity, \n      such as walking, breathing, swallowing, and speaking.  We evaluate the effects of these disorders on motor functioning, bulbar and  neuromuscular functioning, oral communication, or limitations in physical and  mental functioning.\nT.\nHow do we consider symptoms of fatigue in these listings?\nFatigue is one of the most common and limiting symptoms of some neurological disorders, \n      such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. These  disorders may result in physical fatigue (lack of muscle strength) or mental  fatigue (decreased awareness or attention). \n      When we evaluate your fatigue, we will consider the intensity, persistence, and effects of fatigue on your  functioning. \n      This may include information such as the clinical and laboratory data and other objective evidence concerning your neurological deficit, a description of fatigue considered characteristic of your disorder, \n      and information about your functioning. We consider the effects of physical fatigue  on your ability to stand up, balance, walk, \n      or perform fine and gross motor movements using the criteria described in\n11.00D\n. \n      We consider the effects of physical and mental fatigue when we evaluate your physical and mental functioning described in\n11.00G\n.\nU.\nHow do we evaluate your neurological disorder when it does not meet one of these listings?\nIf your neurological  disorder does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether your impairment(s) meets the criteria of a listing in another body system. \n          If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing. \n          See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.\nIf your impairment(s)  does not meet or medically equal the criteria of a listing, you may or may not  have the residual functional capacity to perform your past relevant work or  adjust to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national  economy, which we determine at the fourth and, if necessary, the fifth steps of  the sequential evaluation process in §§ 404.1520 and 416.920 of this chapter.\nWe use the rules in  §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter, as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.",

    "section_number": "12.00",
    "full_text": "12.00 Mental Disorders\nA. How are the listings for mental disorders arranged, and what do they require?\nThe listings for mental disorders are arranged in 11 categories: \n    neurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n); schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (\n12.03\n);\n    depressive, bipolar and related disorders (\n12.04\n); intellectual disorder (\n12.05\n);\n    anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (\n12.06\n); somatic symptom and related disorders (\n12.07\n);\n    personality and impulse-control disorders (\n12.08\n); autism spectrum disorder (\n12.10\n);\n    neurodevelopmental disorders (\n12.11\n); eating disorders (\n12.13\n);\n    and trauma- and stressor-related disorders (\n12.15\n).\nListings\n12.07\n,\n12.08\n,\n12.10\n,\n12.11\n,\n    and\n12.13\nhave two paragraphs, designated A and B; your mental disorder must satisfy the requirements of both paragraphs A and B.\n    Listings\n12.02\n,\n12.03\n,\n12.04\n,\n12.06\n, and\n12.15\nhave three paragraphs, designated A, B, and C;\n    your mental disorder must satisfy the requirements of both paragraphs A and B, or the requirements of both paragraphs A and C.\n    Listing\n12.05\nhas two paragraphs that are unique to that listing (see\n12.00A3\n);\n    your mental disorder must satisfy the requirements of either paragraph A or paragraph B.\nParagraph A of each listing (except\n12.05\n) includes the medical criteria that must be present in your medical evidence.\nParagraph B of each listing (except\n12.05\n) provides the  functional criteria we assess, \n    in conjunction with a rating scale (see\n12.00E\nand\n12.00F\n), to evaluate how your mental disorder limits your functioning. \n    These criteria represent the areas of mental functioning a person uses in a work setting. They  are: understand, remember, or apply information; interact with others; concentrate, persist, or maintain pace; \n    and adapt or manage oneself. We will  determine the degree to which your medically determinable mental impairment affects the four areas of mental functioning and your ability to function independently, \n    appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis (see\n404.1520a(c)(2)\nand\n416.920a(c)(2)\nof this chapter).\n    To satisfy the paragraph B criteria, your mental disorder must result in “extreme” limitation of one, or “marked” limitation of two, of the four areas of mental functioning.\n    (When we refer to “paragraph B criteria” or  “area[s] of mental functioning” in the introductory text of this body system,\n    we mean the criteria in paragraph B of every listing except\n12.05\n.)\nParagraph C of listings\n12.02\n,\n12.03\n,\n12.04\n,\n12.06\n, and\n12.15\nprovides the criteria we use to evaluate “serious and persistent mental disorders.”\n    To satisfy the paragraph C criteria, your mental disorder must be “serious and persistent”; that is,\n    there must be a medically documented history of the existence of the disorder over a period of at least 2 years,\n    and evidence that satisfies the criteria in both C1 and C2 (see\n12.00G\n).\n    (When we refer to  “paragraph C” or “the paragraph C criteria” in the introductory text of this body system,\n    we mean the criteria in paragraph C of listings\n12.02\n,\n12.03\n,\n12.04\n,\n12.06\n, and\n12.15\n.)\nListing\n12.05\nhas two paragraphs, designated A and B, that apply to only intellectual disorder.  \n    Each paragraph requires that you have significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning; significant deficits in current adaptive functioning;  \n    and evidence that demonstrates or supports (is consistent with) the conclusion that your disorder began prior to age 22.\nB. Which mental disorders do we evaluate under each listing category?\nNeurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by a clinically significant decline in cognitive functioning. Symptoms and signs may  include, but are not limited to, disturbances in memory, executive functioning  (that is, higher-level cognitive processes; for example, regulating attention,  planning, inhibiting responses, decision-making), visual-spatial functioning,  language and speech, perception, insight, judgment, and insensitivity to social  standards.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include major neurocognitive disorder; dementia of the Alzheimer type; vascular dementia; \n    dementia due to a medical condition such as a metabolic disease (for example, late-onset Tay-Sachs disease), human immunodeficiency virus infection, vascular  malformation, progressive brain tumor, \n    neurological disease (for example, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonian syndrome, Huntington disease), or traumatic brain injury; \n    or substance-induced cognitive disorder associated with drugs of abuse, medications, or toxins.  \n    (We evaluate neurological disorders under that body system (see\n11.00\n). \n    We evaluate cognitive impairments that result from neurological disorders under\n12.02\nif they do not satisfy the requirements in\n11.00\n(see\n11.00G\n).)\nThis category does not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under intellectual disorder (\n12.05\n),\n    autism spectrum disorder (\n12.10\n), and neurodevelopmental disorders (\n12.11\n).\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (\n12.03\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, causing a clinically significant decline in functioning. Symptoms and signs may  include, but are not limited to, inability to initiate and persist in  goal-directed activities, social withdrawal, flat or inappropriate affect,  poverty of thought and speech, loss of interest or pleasure, disturbances of  mood, odd beliefs and mannerisms, and paranoia.\nExamples of  disorders that we evaluate in this category include schizophrenia,  schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and psychotic disorder due to  another medical condition.\nDepressive, bipolar and related disorders (\n12.04\n).\nThese disorders are  characterized by an irritable, depressed, elevated, or expansive mood, or by a  loss of interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, causing a  clinically significant decline in functioning.  Symptoms and signs may include, but are not limited to, feelings of  hopelessness or guilt, suicidal ideation, a clinically significant change in  body weight or appetite, sleep disturbances, an increase or decrease in energy,  psychomotor abnormalities, disturbed concentration, pressured speech,  grandiosity, reduced impulse control, sadness, euphoria, and social withdrawal.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include bipolar disorders (I or II), cyclothymic disorder, major depressive disorder, persistent depressive  disorder (dysthymia), and bipolar or depressive disorder due to another medical  condition.\nIntellectual disorder (\n12.05\n).\nThis disorder is characterized by significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,  significant deficits in current adaptive functioning, and manifestation of the  disorder before age 22. Signs may  include, but are not limited to, poor conceptual, social, or practical skills  evident in your adaptive functioning.\nThe disorder that we evaluate in this category may be described in the evidence as intellectual  disability, intellectual developmental disorder, or historically used terms  such as “mental retardation.”\nThis category does not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under neurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n),\n    autism spectrum disorder (\n12.10\n), or neurodevelopmental disorders (\n12.11\n).\nAnxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (\n12.06\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by excessive anxiety, worry, apprehension, and fear, or by  avoidance of feelings, thoughts, activities, objects, places, or people.   Symptoms and signs may include, but are not limited to, restlessness,  difficulty concentrating, hyper-vigilance, muscle tension, sleep disturbance,  fatigue, panic attacks, obsessions and compulsions, constant thoughts and fears  about safety, and frequent physical complaints.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and  obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThis category does  not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under trauma- and  stressor-related disorders (\n12.15\n).\nSomatic symptom and related disorders (\n12.07\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by physical symptoms or deficits that are not intentionally  produced or feigned, and that, following clinical investigation, cannot be  fully explained by a general medical condition, another mental disorder, the  direct effects of a substance, or a culturally sanctioned behavior or  experience. These disorders may also be  characterized by a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious medical  condition that has not been identified or diagnosed. Symptoms and signs may include, but are not  limited to, pain and other abnormalities of sensation, gastrointestinal  symptoms, fatigue, a high level of anxiety about personal health status,  abnormal motor movement, pseudoseizures, and pseudoneurological symptoms, such  as blindness or deafness.\nExamples of  disorders that we evaluate in this category include somatic symptom disorder,  illness anxiety disorder, and conversion disorder.\nPersonality and impulse-control disorders (\n12.08\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by enduring, inflexible, maladaptive, and pervasive patterns of  behavior. Onset typically occurs in  adolescence or young adulthood. Symptoms  and signs may include, but are not limited to, patterns of distrust,  suspiciousness, and odd beliefs; social detachment, discomfort, or avoidance;  hypersensitivity to negative evaluation; an excessive need to be taken care of;  difficulty making independent decisions; a preoccupation with orderliness,  perfectionism, and control; and inappropriate, intense, impulsive anger and  behavioral expression grossly out of proportion to any external provocation or  psychosocial stressors.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal,  borderline, avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive personality disorders,  and intermittent explosive disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder (\n12.10\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by qualitative deficits in the development of reciprocal social  interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and symbolic or  imaginative activity; restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of  behavior, interests, and activities; and stagnation of development or loss of  acquired skills early in life. Symptoms  and signs may include, but are not limited to, abnormalities and unevenness in  the development of cognitive skills; unusual responses to sensory stimuli; and  behavioral difficulties, including hyperactivity, short attention span,  impulsivity, aggressiveness, or self-injurious actions.\nExamples of  disorders that we evaluate in this category include autism spectrum disorder  with or without accompanying intellectual impairment, and autism spectrum  disorder with or without accompanying language impairment.\nThis category does not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under neurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n),\n    intellectual disorder (\n12.05\n), and neurodevelopmental disorders (\n12.11\n).\nNeurodevelopmental disorders (\n12.11\n).\nThese disorders are  characterized by onset during the developmental period, that is, during  childhood or adolescence, although sometimes they are not diagnosed until  adulthood. Symptoms and signs may  include, but are not limited to, underlying abnormalities in cognitive  processing (for example, deficits in learning and applying verbal or nonverbal  information, visual perception, memory, or a combination of these); deficits in  attention or impulse control; low frustration tolerance; excessive or poorly  planned motor activity; difficulty with organizing (time, space, materials, or  tasks); repeated accidental injury; and deficits in social skills. Symptoms and signs specific to tic disorders  include sudden, rapid, recurrent,  non-rhythmic, motor movement or vocalization.\nExamples of  disorders that we evaluate in this category include specific learning disorder,  borderline intellectual functioning, and tic disorders (such as Tourette syndrome).\nThis category does not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under neurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n),\n    autism spectrum disorder (\n12.10\n), or personality and impulse-control disorders (\n12.08\n).\nEating disorders (\n12.13\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by disturbances in eating  behavior and preoccupation with, and excessive self-evaluation of, body weight and shape. Symptoms and signs may include, but are not limited to, restriction of energy  consumption when compared with individual requirements;  recurrent episodes of binge eating or behavior intended to prevent weight gain,  such as self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, or misuse of laxatives; mood  disturbances, social withdrawal, or irritability; amenorrhea; dental problems;  abnormal laboratory findings; and cardiac abnormalities.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food disorder.\nTrauma- and stressor-related disorders (\n12.15\n).\nThese disorders are characterized by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic or stressful event, or learning of a traumatic event occurring to a close family member or close friend, and the  psychological aftermath of clinically significant effects on functioning. Symptoms and signs may include, but are not  limited to, distressing memories, dreams, and flashbacks related to the trauma  or stressor; avoidant behavior; diminished interest or participation in  significant activities; persistent negative emotional states (for example,  fear, anger) or persistent inability to experience positive emotions (for  example, satisfaction, affection); anxiety; irritability; aggression;  exaggerated startle response; difficulty concentrating; and sleep disturbance.\nExamples of disorders that we evaluate in this category include posttraumatic stress disorder and other  specified trauma- and stressor-related disorders (such as adjustment-like  disorders with prolonged duration without prolonged duration of stressor).\nThis category does not include the mental disorders that we evaluate under anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (\n12.06\n),\n    and cognitive impairments that result from neurological disorders, such as a traumatic brain injury, which we evaluate under neurocognitive disorders (\n12.02\n).\nC. What evidence do we need to evaluate your mental disorder?\nGeneral.\nWe need objective medical evidence from an acceptable medical source to establish that you have a  medically determinable mental disorder. \n    We also need evidence to assess the severity of your mental disorder and its effects on your ability to function in  a work setting. \n    We will determine the extent and kinds of evidence we need from  medical and nonmedical sources based on the individual facts about your disorder. \n    For additional evidence requirements for intellectual disorder (\n12.05\n), see\n12.00H\n. For our basic rules on evidence,\n    see\n404.1512\n,\n404.1513\n,\n404.1520b\n,\n416.912\n,\n416.913\n, \n    and\n416.920b\nof this chapter.\n    For our rules on evaluating medical opinions, see\n404.1520c\n,\n404.1527\n,\n416.920c\n,\n        and\n416.927\nof this chapter.\n    For our rules on evidence about your symptoms, see\n404.1529\nand\n416.929\nof this chapter.\nEvidence from medical sources.\nWe will consider all relevant medical  evidence about your disorder from your physician, psychologist, and other medical sources, which include health care providers such as physician  assistants, psychiatric nurse practitioners, licensed clinical social workers,  and clinical mental health counselors.  Evidence from your medical sources may include:\nYour reported symptoms.\nYour medical, psychiatric, and psychological history.\nThe results of physical or mental status examinations, structured clinical interviews, psychiatric or psychological rating scales, measures  of adaptive functioning, or other clinical findings.\nPsychological testing, imaging results, or other laboratory findings.\nYour diagnosis.\nThe type, dosage, and beneficial effects of medications  you take.\nThe type, frequency, duration, and beneficial effects of  therapy you receive.\nSide effects of medication or other treatment that limit  your ability to function.\nYour clinical course, including changes in your  medication, therapy, or other treatment, and the time required for therapeutic effectiveness.\nObservations and descriptions of how you function during examinations or therapy.\nInformation about sensory, motor, or speech abnormalities, or about your cultural background (for example, language or customs) that may affect an evaluation of your mental disorder.\nThe expected duration of your symptoms and signs and  their effects on your functioning, both currently and in the future.\nEvidence from you and people who know you.\nWe will consider all relevant evidence about your mental disorder and your daily functioning that we receive from you and  from people who know you. We will ask  about your symptoms, your daily functioning, and your medical treatment. We will ask for information from third  parties who can tell us about your mental disorder, but you must give us  permission to do so. This evidence may  include information from your family, caregivers, friends, neighbors, clergy,  case managers, social workers, shelter staff, or other community support and  outreach workers. We will consider  whether your statements and the statements from third parties are consistent  with the medical and other evidence we have.\nEvidence from school, vocational training, work, and work-related programs.\nSchool.\nYou may have  recently attended or may still be attending school, and you may have received  or may still be receiving special education services. If so, we will try to obtain information from  your school sources when we need it to assess how your mental disorder affects  your ability to function. Examples of  this information include your Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), your  Section 504 plans, comprehensive evaluation reports, school-related therapy  progress notes, information from your teachers about how you function in a  classroom setting, and information about any special services or accommodations  you receive at school.\nVocational training, work, and work-related programs.\nYou  may have recently participated in or may still be participating in vocational training, work-related programs, or work activity. \n    If so, we will try to obtain information from  your training program or your employer when we need it to assess how your mental disorder affects your ability to function. \n    Examples of this information include training or work evaluations, modifications to your work duties or work schedule, and  any special supports or accommodations you have required or now require in order to work. \n    If you have worked or are working through a community mental health program, sheltered or supported work program, rehabilitation program, or transitional employment program, \n    we will consider the type and degree of support you have received or are receiving in order to work (see\n12.00D\n).\nNeed for longitudinal evidence.\nGeneral\n. Longitudinal medical evidence can help us learn how you function over time, and help us evaluate any variations in the level of your functioning.\n        We will request longitudinal evidence of your mental disorder when your medical providers have records concerning you and your mental disorder over a period of  months or perhaps years\n        (see\n404.1512(d)\nand\n416.912(d)\nof this chapter).\nNon-medical sources of longitudinal evidence.\nCertain  situations, such as chronic homelessness, may make it difficult for you to  provide longitudinal medical evidence. If  you have a severe mental disorder, you will probably have evidence of its  effects on your functioning over time, even if you have not had an ongoing  relationship with the medical community or are not currently receiving  treatment. For example, family members,  friends, neighbors, former employers, social workers, case managers, community  support staff, outreach workers, or government agencies may be familiar with  your mental health history. We will ask  for information from third parties who can tell us about your mental disorder,  but you must give us permission to do so.\nAbsence of longitudinal evidence.\nIn the absence of longitudinal evidence, \n    we will use current objective medical evidence and all other relevant evidence available to us in your case record to evaluate your mental disorder. If we purchase a consultative examination to document your disorder, \n    the record will include the results of that examination \n    (see\n404.1514\nand\n416.914\nof this chapter).\n    We will take into consideration your medical history, symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings, and medical source opinions. If you do not have longitudinal evidence,\n    the current evidence alone may not be sufficient or appropriate to show that you have a disorder that meets the criteria of one of the mental disorders listings.\n    In that case, we will follow the rules in\n12.00J\n.\nEvidence of functioning in unfamiliar situations or supportive situations.\nUnfamiliar situations.\nWe recognize that evidence about your functioning in unfamiliar situations does not necessarily show how you would function on a sustained basis in a work setting. In one-time, time-limited, or other  unfamiliar situations, you may function differently than you do in familiar  situations. In unfamiliar situations,  you may appear more, or less, limited than you do on a daily basis and over  time.\nSupportive situations.\nYour ability to complete  tasks in settings that are highly structured, or that are less demanding or more supportive than typical work settings does not necessarily demonstrate  your ability to complete tasks in the context of regular employment during a  normal workday or work week.\nOur assessment.\nWe must assess your ability to complete tasks  by evaluating all the evidence, such as reports about your functioning from you  and third parties who are familiar with you, with an emphasis on how  independently, appropriately, and effectively you are able to complete tasks on  a sustained basis.\nD. How do we consider psychosocial supports, structured settings,  living arrangements, and treatment?\nGeneral.\nPsychosocial  supports, structured settings, and living arrangements, including assistance  from your family or others, may help you by reducing the demands made on  you. In addition, treatment you receive  may reduce your symptoms and signs and possibly improve your functioning, or  may have side effects that limit your functioning. Therefore, when we evaluate the effects of  your mental disorder and rate the limitation of your areas of mental functioning,  we will consider the kind and extent of supports you receive, the  characteristics of any structured setting in which you spend your time, and the  effects of any treatment. This evidence  may come from reports about your functioning from you or third parties who are  familiar with you, and other third-party statements or information. Following are some examples of the supports  you may receive:\nYou receive help  from family members or other people who monitor your daily activities and help  you to function. For example, family  members administer your medications, remind you to eat, shop for you and pay  your bills, or change their work hours so you are never home alone.\nYou participate in a special education or vocational training program, or a psychosocial  rehabilitation day treatment or community support program, where you receive  training in daily living and entry-level work skills.\nYou participate in a sheltered, supported, or transitional work program, or in a competitive  employment setting with the help of a job coach or supervisor.\nYou receive comprehensive “24/7 wrap-around” mental health services while living in a group  home or transitional housing, while participating in a semi-independent living  program, or while living in individual housing (for example, your own home or  apartment).\nYou live in a hospital or other institution with 24-hour care.\nYou receive assistance from a crisis response team, social workers, or community mental  health workers who help you meet your physical needs, and who may also  represent you in dealings with government or community social services.\nYou live alone and  do not receive any psychosocial support(s); however, you have created a highly  structured environment by eliminating all but minimally necessary contact with  the world outside your living space.\nHow we consider different levels of support and structure in  psychosocial rehabilitation programs.\nPsychosocial  rehabilitation programs are based on your specific needs. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions  about your mental disorder based solely on the fact that you are associated  with such a program. We must know the  details of the program(s) in which you are involved and the pattern(s) of your  involvement over time.\nThe kinds and levels  of supports and structures in psychosocial rehabilitation programs typically  occur on a scale of “most restrictive” to “least restrictive.” Participation in a psychosocial  rehabilitation program at the most restrictive level would suggest greater  limitation of your areas of mental functioning than would participation at a  less restrictive level. The length of  time you spend at different levels in a program also provides information about  your functioning. For example, you could  begin participation at the most restrictive crisis intervention level but  gradually improve to the point of readiness for a lesser level of support and  structure and possibly some form of employment.\nHow we consider the help or support you receive.\nWe will consider the  complete picture of your daily functioning, including the kinds, extent, and  frequency of help and support you receive, when we evaluate your mental  disorder and determine whether you are able to use the four areas of mental functioning  in a work setting. The fact that you  have done, or currently do, some routine activities without help or support  does not necessarily mean that you do not have a mental disorder or that you  are not disabled. For example, you may  be able to take care of your personal needs, cook, shop, pay your bills, live  by yourself, and drive a car. You may  demonstrate both strengths and deficits in your daily functioning.\nYou may receive various kinds of help and support from others that enable you to do many things that, because of your mental disorder, you might not be able to do independently. \n    Your daily functioning  may depend on the special contexts in which you function. For example, you may spend your time among  only familiar people or surroundings, in a simple and steady routine or an unchanging environment, \n    or in a highly structured setting. However, this does not necessarily show how  you would function in a work setting on a sustained basis, throughout a normal  workday and workweek. \n    (See\n12.00H\nfor further discussion of these issues regarding significant deficits in adaptive functioning for the purpose of\n12.05\n.)\nHow we consider treatment.\nWe will consider the effect of any treatment on your functioning when we evaluate your mental disorder. Treatment may include medication(s), psychotherapy, or other forms of intervention, which  you receive in a doctor’s office, during a hospitalization, or in a day program  at a hospital or outpatient treatment program.  With treatment, you may not only have your symptoms and signs reduced,  but may also be able to function in a work setting. However, treatment may not resolve all of the  limitations that result from your mental disorder, and the medications you take  or other treatment you receive for your disorder may cause side effects that  limit your mental or physical functioning. For example, you may experience drowsiness,  blunted affect, memory loss, or abnormal involuntary movements.\nE. What are the paragraph B criteria?\nUnderstand, remember, or apply information (paragraph B1).\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the abilities to learn,  recall, and use information to perform work activities. Examples include: understanding and learning terms,  instructions, procedures; following one- or two-step oral instructions to carry  out a task; describing work activity to someone else; asking and answering  questions and providing explanations; recognizing a mistake and correcting it;  identifying and solving problems; sequencing multi-step activities; and using  reason and judgment to make work-related decisions. These examples illustrate the nature of this  area of mental functioning. We do not  require documentation of all of the examples.\nInteract with others (paragraph B2).\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the abilities to relate to and work with supervisors,  co-workers, and the public. Examples  include: cooperating with others; asking  for help when needed; handling conflicts with others; stating own point of  view; initiating or sustaining conversation; understanding and responding to  social cues (physical, verbal, emotional); responding to requests, suggestions,  criticism, correction, and challenges; and keeping social interactions free of excessive  irritability, sensitivity, argumentativeness, or suspiciousness. These examples illustrate the nature of this  area of mental functioning. We do not  require documentation of all of the examples.\nConcentrate, persist, or maintain pace (paragraph B3).\nThis area of mental functioning refers to the  abilities to focus attention on work activities and stay on task at a sustained  rate. Examples include: initiating and performing a task that you  understand and know how to do; working at an appropriate and consistent pace;  completing tasks in a timely manner; ignoring or avoiding distractions while  working; changing activities or work settings without being disruptive; working  close to or with others without interrupting or distracting them; sustaining an  ordinary routine and regular attendance at work; and working a full day without  needing more than the allotted number or length of rest periods during the  day. These examples illustrate the  nature of this area of mental functioning.  We do not require documentation of all of the examples.\nAdapt or manage oneself (paragraph B4).\nThis area of mental functioning refers to  the abilities to regulate emotions, control behavior, and maintain well-being  in a work setting. Examples  include: responding to demands; adapting to changes; managing your psychologically  based symptoms; distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable work  performance; setting realistic goals; making plans for yourself independently  of others; maintaining personal hygiene and attire appropriate to a work  setting; and being aware of normal hazards and taking appropriate precautions. These examples illustrate the nature of this  area of mental functioning. We do not  require documentation of all of the examples.\nF. How do we use the paragraph B criteria to evaluate your mental  disorder?\nGeneral.\nWe use the paragraph B criteria, in conjunction with a rating scale (see\n12.00F2\n), \n    to rate the degree of your limitations. We consider only the limitations that result from your mental disorder(s). We will determine whether you are able to use each of the paragraph B areas of mental functioning in a work setting. \n    We will consider, for example, the kind, degree, and frequency of difficulty you would have; whether you could function without extra help, structure, or supervision; \n    and whether you would require special conditions with regard to activities or other people (see\n12.00D\n).\nThe five-point rating scale.\nWe evaluate the effects of your mental disorder on each of the four  areas of mental functioning based on a five-point rating scale consisting of  none, mild, moderate, marked, and extreme limitation. To satisfy the paragraph B criteria, your  mental disorder must result in extreme limitation of one, or marked limitation  of two, paragraph B areas of mental functioning. Under these listings, the five rating points  are defined as follows:\nNo limitation (or none).\nYou  are able to function in this area independently, appropriately, effectively,  and on a sustained basis.\nMild limitation.\nYour  functioning in this area independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a  sustained basis is slightly limited.\nModerate limitation.\nYour  functioning in this area independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a  sustained basis is fair.\nMarked limitation.\nYour  functioning in this area independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a  sustained basis is seriously limited.\nExtreme limitation.\nYou are  not able to function in this area independently, appropriately, effectively,  and on a sustained basis.\nRating the limitations of your areas of mental functioning.\nGeneral.\nWe use all of the relevant medical and  non-medical evidence in your case record to evaluate your mental disorder: the symptoms and signs of your disorder, the  reported limitations in your activities, and any help and support you receive  that is necessary for you to function.  The medical evidence may include descriptors regarding the diagnostic  stage or level of your disorder, such as “mild” or “moderate.” Clinicians may use these terms to  characterize your medical condition.  However, these terms will not always be the same as the degree of your  limitation in a paragraph B area of mental functioning.\nAreas of mental  functioning in daily activities.\nYou  use the same four areas of mental functioning in daily activities at home and  in the community that you would use to function at work. With respect to a particular task or  activity, you may have trouble using one or more of the areas. For example, you may have difficulty  understanding and remembering what to do; or concentrating and staying on task  long enough to do it; or engaging in the task or activity with other people; or  trying to do the task without becoming frustrated and losing self-control. Information about your daily functioning can  help us understand whether your mental disorder limits one or more of these  areas; and, if so, whether it also affects your ability to function in a work  setting.\nAreas of mental functioning  in work settings\n. If you have  difficulty using an area of mental functioning from day-to-day at home or in  your community, you may also have difficulty using that area to function in a  work setting. On the other hand, if you  are able to use an area of mental functioning at home or in your community, we  will not necessarily assume that you would also be able to use that area to  function in a work setting where the demands and stressors differ from those at  home. We will consider all evidence  about your mental disorder and daily functioning before we reach a conclusion  about your ability to work.\nOverall effect of  limitations.\nLimitation of an area  of mental functioning reflects the overall degree to which your mental disorder  interferes with that area. The  degree of limitation is how we document our assessment of your limitation when  using the area of mental functioning independently, appropriately, effectively,  and on a sustained basis.  It does not  necessarily reflect a specific type or number of activities, including  activities of daily living, that you have difficulty doing. In addition, no single piece of information  (including test results) can establish the degree of limitation of an area of  mental functioning.\nEffects of support, supervision, structure on functionin\ng. \n    The degree of limitation of an area of mental functioning also reflects the kind and extent of supports or supervision you receive and the characteristics of any structured setting where you spend your time, \n    which enable you to function. The more extensive the support you need from others or the more structured the setting you need in order to function, \n    the more limited we will find you to be (see\n12.00D\n).\nSpecific instructions for paragraphs B1, B3, and B4.\nFor paragraphs B1, B3, and B4, the greatest  degree of limitation of any part of the area of mental functioning directs the  rating of limitation of that whole area of mental functioning.\nTo do a work-related task, you must be able to understand\nand\nremember\nand\napply information required by the task.  Similarly,  you must be able to concentrate\nand\npersist\nand\nmaintain pace in  order to complete the task, and adapt\nand\nmanage yourself in the  workplace.  Limitation in any one of these parts (understand\nor\nremember\nor\napply; concentrate\nor\npersist\nor\nmaintain  pace; adapt\nor\nmanage oneself) may prevent you from completing a  work-related task.\nWe will document the rating of limitation of the whole area  of mental functioning, not each individual part.  We will not add ratings  of the parts together.  For example, with respect to paragraph B3, if you  have marked limitation in maintaining pace, and mild or moderate limitations in  concentrating and persisting, we will find that you have marked limitation in  the whole paragraph B3 area of mental functioning.\nMarked limitation in more than one part of the same  paragraph B area of mental functioning does not satisfy the requirement to have  marked limitation in two paragraph B areas of mental functioning.\nHow we evaluate mental disorders involving exacerbations and  remissions.\nWhen we evaluate the effects of your mental disorder, we will  consider how often you have exacerbations and remissions, how long they last,  what causes your mental disorder to worsen or improve, and any other relevant  information. We will assess any  limitation of the affected paragraph B area(s) of mental functioning using the  rating scale for the paragraph B criteria.  We will consider whether you can use the area of mental functioning on a  regular and continuing basis (8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or an equivalent  work schedule). We will not find that  you are able to work solely because you have a period(s) of improvement  (remission), or that you are disabled solely because you have a period of  worsening (exacerbation), of your mental disorder.\nIf you have a mental disorder involving exacerbations and  remissions, you may be able to use the four areas of mental functioning to work  for a few weeks or months. Recurrence or  worsening of symptoms and signs, however, can interfere enough to render you  unable to sustain the work.\nG. What are the  paragraph C criteria, and how do we use them to evaluate your mental disorder?\nGeneral.\nThe paragraph C criteria are an alternative to the paragraph B criteria under listings\n12.02\n,\n12.03\n,\n12.04\n,\n12.06\n, and\n12.15\n.\n        We use the paragraph C criteria to evaluate mental disorders that are “serious and  persistent.” In the paragraph C criteria,\n        we recognize that mental health interventions may control the more obvious symptoms and signs of your mental disorder.\nParagraph C criteria.\nWe find a mental disorder to be “serious and persistent” when there is a medically documented history of the existence of the mental disorder in the listing category over a  period of at least 2 years, and evidence shows that your disorder satisfies  both C1 and C2.\nThe criterion in C1 is satisfied when the evidence shows that you rely, on an ongoing basis, upon  medical treatment, mental health therapy, psychosocial support(s), \n    or a highly structured setting(s), to diminish the symptoms and signs of your mental  disorder (see\n12.00D\n).\n    We consider that you receive ongoing medical treatment when the medical evidence establishes that you obtain medical treatment with a frequency consistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment\n    or evaluation required for your  medical condition. We will consider periods of inconsistent treatment or lack of compliance with treatment that may result from your mental disorder.\n    If the evidence indicates that the inconsistent treatment or lack of compliance is a feature of your mental disorder, and it has led to an exacerbation of your symptoms and signs,\n    we will not use it as evidence to support a finding that you have not received ongoing medical treatment as required by this paragraph.\nThe criterion in C2 is satisfied when the evidence shows that, despite your diminished symptoms and signs, you have achieved only marginal adjustment. \n    “Marginal adjustment” means that your  adaptation to the requirements of daily life is fragile; that is, \n    you have minimal capacity to adapt to changes in your environment or to demands that are not already part of your daily life. \n    We will consider that you have achieved only marginal adjustment when the evidence shows that changes or increased demands have led to exacerbation of your symptoms and signs and to deterioration in your functioning; \n    for example, you have become unable to function outside of your home or a more restrictive  setting, without substantial psychosocial supports (see\n12.00D\n).\n    Such deterioration may have necessitated a significant change in medication or other treatment. Similarly, because of the nature of your mental disorder,\n    evidence may document episodes of deterioration that have required you to be hospitalized or absent from work, making it difficult for you to sustain work activity over time.\nH. How do we document and evaluate intellectual disorder under\n12.05\n?\nGeneral.\nListing\n12.05\nis  based on the three elements that characterize intellectual disorder: significantly subaverage general intellectual  functioning; significant deficits in current adaptive functioning; and the  disorder manifested before age 22.\nEstablishing significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning.\nDefinition.\nIntellectual functioning refers to the general mental capacity to learn, reason, plan, solve  problems, and perform other cognitive functions. \n    Under\n12.05A\n, we identify significantly  subaverage general intellectual functioning by the cognitive inability to function at a level required to participate in standardized intelligence testing.\n    Our findings under 12.05A are based on evidence from an acceptable medical source.\n    Under\n12.05B\n, we identify significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning by an IQ score(s) on an individually administered standardized test of general intelligence that meets\n    program requirements and has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n    A qualified specialist (see\n12.00H2c\n) must administer the standardized intelligence testing.\nPsychometric standards.\nWe will find standardized intelligence test results usable for the purposes of\n12.05B1\nwhen the measure employed meets contemporary psychometric standards for validity, reliability, normative data, and scope of measurement;\n    and a qualified specialist has individually administered the test according to all pre-requisite testing conditions.\nQualified specialist.\nA “qualified specialist” is currently licensed or certified at the independent level of  practice in the State where the test was performed, \n    and has the training and  experience to administer, score, and interpret intelligence tests. If a psychological  assistant or paraprofessional administered the test, a supervisory qualified  specialist must interpret the test findings and co-sign the examination  report.\nResponsibility for conclusions based on testing.\nWe generally presume that your obtained IQ  score(s) is an accurate reflection of your general intellectual functioning,  unless evidence in the record suggests otherwise. Examples of this evidence include: a statement from the test administrator  indicating that your obtained score is not an accurate reflection of your  general intellectual functioning, prior or internally inconsistent IQ scores,  or information about your daily functioning.  Only qualified specialists, Federal and State agency medical and  psychological consultants, and other contracted medical and psychological  experts may conclude that your obtained IQ score(s)  is not an accurate reflection of your general intellectual functioning. This conclusion must be well supported  by appropriate clinical and laboratory diagnostic  techniques and must be based on relevant evidence in the case record,  such as:\nThe data obtained in testing;\nYour developmental history, including when your signs and symptoms began;\nInformation about how you function on a daily basis in a variety of settings; and\nClinical observations made during the testing period, such as your ability to sustain attention, concentration, and effort; to relate appropriately to the examiner; and to perform tasks independently without prompts or reminders.\nEstablishing significant deficits in adaptive functioning.\nDefinition. Adaptive functioning refers to how you learn and use conceptual, social, and practical skills in dealing with common life demands.  \n    It is your typical functioning at home and in the community, alone or among others.  Under\n12.05A\n,\n    we identify significant deficits in adaptive functioning based on your dependence on others to care for your personal needs, such as eating and bathing.\n    We will base our conclusions about your adaptive functioning on evidence from a variety of sources (see\n12.00H3b\n) and not on your statements alone.\n    Under\n12.05B2\n, we identify significant deficits in adaptive functioning based on whether there is extreme limitation of one, or marked limitation of two,\n    of the paragraph B criteria (see\n12.00E\n;\n12.00F\n).\nEvidence. Evidence about your adaptive functioning may come from:\nMedical sources, including their clinical observations;\nStandardized tests of adaptive functioning (see\n12.00H3c\n);\nThird party information, such as a report of your functioning from a family member or friend;\nSchool records, if you were in school recently;\nReports from employers or supervisors; and\nYour own statements about how you handle all of your daily activities.\nStandardized tests of adaptive functioning.  We do not require the results of an individually administered standardized test of adaptive functioning.  \n    If your case record includes these test results, we will consider the results along with all other relevant evidence; however, \n    we will use the guidelines in\n12.00E\nand\nF\nto evaluate and determine the degree of your deficits in adaptive functioning,\n    as required under\n12.05B2\n.\nHow we consider common everyday activities.\nThe fact that you engage in common everyday activities, such as caring for your personal needs, preparing simple meals, or driving a car, \n    will not always mean that you do not have deficits in adaptive functioning as required by\n12.05B2\n. You may demonstrate both strengths and  deficits in your adaptive functioning.\n    However, a lack of deficits in one area does not negate the presence of deficits in another area. When we assess your adaptive functioning,\n    we will consider all of your activities and your performance of them.\nOur conclusions about your adaptive functioning rest on whether you do your daily activities independently, appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis. \n    If you receive help in performing your activities, we need to know the kind, extent, and frequency of help you receive in order to perform them. \n    We will not  assume that your ability to do some common everyday activities, or to do some things without help or support, \n    demonstrates that your mental disorder does not meet the requirements of\n12.05B2\n.\n    (See\n12.00D\nregarding the factors we consider when we evaluate your functioning, including how we consider any help or support you receive.)\nHow we consider work activity.  The fact that you have engaged in work activity, or that you work intermittently or steadily in a job commensurate with your abilities, \n    will not always mean that you do not have deficits in adaptive functioning as required by\n12.05B2\n.  When you have engaged in work activity,\n    we need complete information about the work, and about your functioning in the work activity and work setting, before we reach any conclusions about your adaptive functioning.\n    We will consider all factors involved in your work history before concluding whether your impairment satisfies the criteria for intellectual disorder under\n12.05B\n.\n    We will consider your prior and current work history, if any, and various other factors influencing how you function.\n    For example, we consider whether the work was in a supported setting, whether you required more supervision than other employees, how your job duties compared to others in the same job,\n    how much time it took you to learn the job duties, and the reason the work ended, if applicable.\nEstablishing that the disorder began before age 22.  We require evidence that demonstrates or supports (is consistent with) the conclusion that your mental disorder began prior to age 22.  \n    We do not require evidence that your impairment met all of the requirements of\n12.05A\nor\n12.05B\nprior to age 22.  A\n    lso, we do not require you to have met our statutory definition of disability prior to age 22.  When we do not have evidence that was recorded before you attained age 22,\n    we need evidence about your current intellectual and adaptive functioning and the history of your disorder that supports the conclusion that the disorder began before you attained age 22.\n    Examples of evidence that can demonstrate or support this conclusion include:\nTests of intelligence or adaptive functioning;\nSchool records indicating a history of special education services based on your intellectual functioning;\nAn Individualized Education Program (IEP), including your transition plan;\nReports of your academic performance and functioning at school;\nMedical treatment records;\nInterviews or reports from employers;\nStatements from a supervisor in a group home or a sheltered workshop; and\nStatements from people who have known you and can tell us about your functioning in the past and currently.\nI. How do we evaluate substance use disorders?\nIf we find that you are disabled and there is medical evidence in your case record establishing that you have a substance use disorder, \n    we will determine whether your substance use  disorder is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability  \n    (see §§\n404.1535\nand\n416.935\nof this chapter).\nJ. How do we evaluate mental disorders that do not meet one of the mental disorders listings?\nThese listings include only examples of mental disorders that we consider serious enough to prevent you from doing any gainful activity.  \n    If your severe mental disorder does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we will consider whether you have an impairment(s) that meets the criteria of a listing in another body system.  \n    You may have another impairment(s) that is secondary to your mental disorder.  For example, if you have an eating disorder and develop a cardiovascular impairment because of it, \n    we will evaluate your cardiovascular impairment under the listings for the cardiovascular body system.\nIf you have a severe  medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will  determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing \n    (see\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter).\nIf your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, we will assess your residual functional capacity for engaging in substantial gainful activity \n    (see\n404.1545\nand\n416.945\nof this chapter).  When we assess your residual functional capacity, \n    we consider all of your impairment-related mental and physical  limitations.  For example, the side effects of some medications may reduce your general alertness, concentration, or physical stamina, \n    affecting your residual functional capacity for non-exertional or exertional work  activities.  Once we have determined your residual functional capacity, we proceed to the fourth, and if necessary, \n    the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter. \n    We use the  rules in\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter, as appropriate, when we  decide whether you continue to be disabled.",

    "full_text": "13.00 Cancer\nA.\nWhat impairments do  these listings cover?\nWe  use these listings to evaluate all\ncancers (malignant neoplastic  diseases) except certain cancers associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n          We use the criteria in\n14.11B\nto evaluate primary central nervous system lymphoma,\n14.11C\nto evaluate primary effusion lymphoma, \n          and\n14.11E\nto evaluate pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma if you also have HIV infection.\n    We evaluate all other cancers associated with HIV infection, for example, Hodgkin lymphoma or non-pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, under this body system or under\n14.11F–I\nin the immune system disorders body system.\nB.\nWhat do we consider\n                  when we evaluate cancer under these listings?\nWe\n          consider factors including:\n1. Origin of the cancer.\n2. Extent of involvement.\n3. Duration, frequency, and response to anticancer therapy.\n4. Effects of any\n          post-therapeutic residuals.\nC.\nHow do we apply these listings?\nWe\n          apply the criteria in a specific listing to a cancer\n          originating from that specific site.\nD.\nWhat evidence do we need?\n1. We need medical\n          evidence that specifies the type, extent, and site of the primary,\n          recurrent, or metastatic lesion. When the primary site cannot be\n          identified, we will use evidence documenting the site(s) of metastasis\n          to evaluate the impairment under\n13.27\n.\n2. For operative procedures,\n          including a biopsy or a needle aspiration, we generally need\n          a copy of both the:\na. Operative note, and\nb. Pathology report.\n3. When we cannot get these\n          documents, we will accept the summary of hospitalization(s)\n          or other medical reports. This evidence should include details\n          of the findings at surgery and, whenever appropriate, the pathological\n          findings.\n4. In some situations we may also need evidence about\n          recurrence, persistence, or progression of the cancer, the\n          response to therapy, and any significant residuals. (See\n13.00G\n.)\nE.\nWhen do we need longitudinal evidence?\n1.\nCancer\n                  with distant metastases.\nWe generally do not\n          need longitudinal evidence for cancer that has metastasized beyond\n          the regional lymph nodes because this cancer usually meets the\n          requirements of a listing. Exceptions are for cancer with distant\n          metastases that we expect to respond to anticancer therapy.\n          For these exceptions, we usually need a longitudinal record of\n          3 months after therapy starts to determine whether the therapy\n          achieved its intended effect, and whether this effect is likely to persist.\n2.\nOther\n                  cancers\n. When there are no distant metastases,\n          many of the listings require that we consider your response to\n          initial anticancer therapy; that is, the initial planned\n          treatment regimen. This therapy may consist of a single modality\n          or a combination of modalities; that is, multimodal therapy (see\n13.00I4\n).\n3\n.\nTypes of Treatment\n.\na. Whenever the initial planned therapy is a single modality, enough time must pass to allow a determination about whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect. \n      If the treatment fails, the failure often happens within 6 months after the treatment starts, and there will often be a change in the treatment regimen.\nb. Whenever the initial planned therapy is multimodal, \n          we usually cannot make a determination about the effectiveness of the therapy until we can determine the effects of all the planned modalities. \n          In some cases, we may need to defer adjudication until we can assess the  effectiveness of therapy. \n          However, we do not need to defer adjudication to determine whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect if we can make a fully favorable determination or decision based on the length and effects of therapy, \n          or the residuals of the cancer or therapy (see\n13.00G\n).\nc. We need evidence under\n13.02E\n,\n13.11D\n,\n          and\n13.14C\nto establish that your treating source initiated multimodal anticancer therapy.\n          We do not need to make a determination about the length or effectiveness of your therapy. Multimodal therapy has been initiated, and satisfies the requirements in\n13.02E\n,\n13.11D\n, and\n13.14C\n, when your treating source starts the first modality. \n          We may defer adjudication if your treating source plans multimodal therapy and has not initiated it.\nF.\nHow do we evaluate impairments that do not\n                  meet one of the cancer listings?\n1. These listings are only examples of cancer\n          that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful\n          activity. If your severe impairment(s) does not meet the criteria\n          of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have\n          an impairment(s) that meets the criteria of a listing in another\n          body system.\n2. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s)\n          that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s)\n          medically equals a listing. (See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nof this chapter.)\n    If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing,\n    you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage\n    in substantial gainful activity. In that situation, we proceed\n    to the fourth, and, if necessary, the fifth steps of the sequential\n    evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter.\n    We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\nand\n416.994\nof this chapter,\n    as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nG.\nHow do we consider the effects of anticancer therapy?\n1.\nHow we consider the effects of anticancer therapy under the listings\n.\nIn many cases, cancers meet listing criteria only if the therapy is not effective\n          and the cancer persists, progresses, or recurs. However, as explained\n          in the following paragraphs, we will not delay adjudication if\n          we can make a fully favorable determination or decision based on\n          the evidence in the case record.\n2.\nEffects can vary widely\n.\na. We consider each case on an individual basis because the therapy\n          and its toxicity may vary widely. We will request a specific description of the therapy,\n          including these items:\ni. Drugs given.\nii. Dosage.\niii. Frequency of drug administration.\niv. Plans for continued drug administration.\nv. Extent of surgery.\nvi. Schedule and fields of radiation therapy.\nb. We will also request a description of the complications or\n          adverse effects of therapy, such as the following:\ni. Continuing gastrointestinal symptoms.\nii. Persistent weakness.\niii. Neurological complications.\niv. Cardiovascular complications.\nv. Reactive mental disorders.\n3.\nEffects of therapy may change\n.\nThe severity of the adverse effects of anticancer therapy may\n          change during treatment; therefore, enough time must pass to allow us to evaluate\n          the therapy's effect. The residual effects of treatment are temporary\n          in most instances; however on occasion, the effects may be disabling for a consecutive\n          period of at least 12 months. In some situations, very serious adverse effects may interrupt\n          and prolong multimodal anticancer therapy for a continuous period of almost 12 months.\n          In these situations, we may determine there is an expectation that your impairment will preclude\n          you from engaging in any gainful activity for at least 12 months.\n4.\nWhen the initial anticancer therapy is effective\n.\nWe evaluate any post-therapeutic residual impairment(s) not included\n          in these listings under the criteria for the affected body system.\n          We must consider any complications of therapy. When the residual\n          impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, we must\n          consider its effect on your ability to do substantial gainful activity.\nH.\nHow long do we consider your impairment to be disabling?\n1. In some listings, we specify that we will consider your impairment\n          to be disabling until a particular point in time (for example,\n          until at least 12 months from the date of transplantation). We may consider\n          your impairment to be disabling beyond this point when the medical and\n          other evidence justifies it.\n2. When a listing does not contain such a specification, we will\n          consider an impairment(s) that meets or medically equals a listing\n          in this body system to be disabling until at least 3 years after\n          onset of complete remission. When the impairment(s) has been in\n          complete remission for at least 3 years, that is, the original\n          tumor or a recurrence (or relapse) and any metastases have not been evident for at least 3 years,\n          the impairment(s) will no longer meet or medically equal the criteria\n          of a listing in this body system.\n3. Following the appropriate period, we will consider any residuals,\n          including residuals of the cancer or therapy (see\n13.00G\n),\n    in determining whether you are disabled. If you have a recurrence or relapse of your cancer, your impairment may meet or medically equal one of  the listings in this body system again.\nI.\nWhat do we mean by the following terms?\n1.\nAnticancer therapy\nmeans surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormones,\n          immunotherapy, or bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. When we refer to surgery as an anticancer treatment, we mean surgical excisions for treatment, not for diagnostic purposes.\n2.\nInoperable\nmeans surgery is thought to be of no therapeutic value or the surgery cannot be performed; for example, when you cannot tolerate anesthesia or surgery because of another impairment(s), or you have a cancer that is  too large or that has invaded crucial structures. This term does not include  situations in which your cancer could have been surgically removed but another  method of treatment was chosen; for example, an attempt at organ preservation.  Your physician may determine whether the cancer is inoperable before or after you  receive neoadjuvant therapy.\nNeoadjuvant  therapy\nis anticancer therapy, such as chemotherapy or radiation, given  before surgery in order to reduce the size of the cancer.\n3.\nMetastases\nmeans the spread of cancer cells by blood, lymph, or other body fluid.   This term does not include the spread of cancer cells by direct extension  of the cancer to other tissues or organs.\n4.\nMultimodal therapy\nmeans anticancer therapy that is a combination of at least two types of treatment given in close proximity as a unified whole and usually planned before any treatment has begun. There are three types of treatment modalities: surgery, radiation, and systemic drug therapy (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy or biological modifier therapy. Examples of  multimodal therapy include:\nSurgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation.\nChemotherapy followed by surgery.\nChemotherapy and concurrent radiation.\n5.\nPersistent\nmeans the planned initial anticancer therapy failed to achieve a complete remission of your cancer; that is, your cancer is evident, even if smaller, after the therapy has ended.\n6.\nProgressive\nProgressive means the cancer becomes more extensive after treatment; that is, there is evidence that your cancer is growing after you have completed at least half of your planned initial anticancer therapy.\n7.\nRecurrent, relapse\nmeans the cancer that was in complete remission or entirely removed by surgery has returned.\n8.\nUnresectable\nmeans surgery  or surgeries did not completely remove the cancer. This term includes  situations in which your cancer is incompletely resected or the surgical margins  are positive. It does not include situations in which there is a finding of a positive margin(s) if additional surgery obtains a margin(s) that is clear. It does not include situations in which the cancer is completely resected but you are receiving adjuvant therapy.\n          Adjuvant therapy is anticancer therapy, such as chemotherapy or radiation, given after surgery  in order to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and lessen the chance of recurrence.\nJ.\nCan we establish the existence of a disabling impairment\n                  prior to the date of the evidence that shows the cancer satisfies\n                  the criteria of a listing?\nYes. We will consider factors\n          such as:\n1. The type of cancer and its location.\n2. The extent of involvement when the cancer was first demonstrated.\n3. Your symptoms.\nK.\nHow do we evaluate specific cancers\n?\n1.\nLymphoma\n.\na. Many indolent (non-aggressive) lymphomas are controlled by well-tolerated treatment modalities, although the lymphomas may produce intermittent symptoms and signs. \n      We may defer adjudicating these cases for an appropriate period after therapy is initiated  to determine whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect, which is usually to stabilize the disease process. \n      (See\n13.00E3\n.) Once your disease stabilizes, we will assess severity based on the extent of involvement of  other organ systems and residuals from therapy.\nb. A change in therapy for indolent lymphomas is usually an indicator that  the therapy is not achieving its intended effect. \n          However, your impairment will  not meet the requirements of\n13.05A2\nif your therapy is changed solely because you or your physician chooses to change it,\n    and not because of a failure to achieve stability.\nc. We consider Hodgkin lymphoma that recurs more than 12 months\n          after completing initial anticancer therapy to be a new disease\n          rather than a recurrence.\n2.\nLeukemia\n.\na.\nAcute leukemia\n. The initial diagnosis of acute leukemia,\n          including the accelerated or blast phase of chronic myelogenous\n          (granulocytic) leukemia, is based upon definitive bone marrow examination.\n          Additional diagnostic information is based on chromosomal analysis,\n          cytochemical and surface marker studies on the abnormal cells,\n          or other methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical\n          knowledge and clinical practice. Recurrent disease must be documented\n          by peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid examination, or by testicular biopsy.\n          The initial and follow-up pathology reports should be included.\nb.\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\n.\nWe need\n          a diagnosis of CML based upon documented granulocytosis, including\n          immature forms such as differentiated or undifferentiated myelocytes\n          and myeloblasts, and a chromosomal analysis that demonstrates the\n          Philadelphia chromosome. In the absence of a chromosomal analysis,\n          or if the Philadelphia chromosome is not present, the diagnosis\n          may be made by other methods consistent with the prevailing state\n          of medical knowledge and clinical practice. The requirement of CML\n          in the accelerated or blast phase is met in 13.06B if laboratory\n          findings show the proportion of blast (immature) cells in the peripheral\n          blood or bone marrow is 10 percent or greater.\nc.\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\n.\ni. We require the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n          (CLL) to be documented by evidence of a chronic lymphocytosis\n          of at least 10,000/mm3 for 3 months or longer, or other acceptable\n          diagnostic techniques consistent with the prevailing state of medical\n          knowledge and clinical practice.\nii. We evaluate the complications and residual impairment(s)\n          from CLL under the appropriate listings, such as\n13.05A2\n, \n          or the hematological listings (\n7.00\n).\nd.\nElevated white cell count\n.\nIn cases of chronic leukemia\n          (either myelogenous or lymphocytic), an elevated white cell count,\n          in itself, is not a factor in determining the severity\n          of the impairment.\n3.\nMacroglobulinemia or heavy chain disease\n.\nWe require the diagnosis\n          of these diseases  to be confirmed by protein electrophoresis\n          or immunoelectrophoresis. We evaluate the resulting impairment(s)\n          under the appropriate listings, such as\n13.05A2\nor the hematological listings (\n7.00\n).\n4.\nPrimary breast cancer\n.\na. We evaluate bilateral primary breast cancer (synchronous or metachronous) under\n13.10A\n,\n    which covers local primary disease, and not as a primary disease that has metastasized.\nb. We evaluate secondary lymphedema that results from anticancer therapy for breast cancer under\n13.10E\nif the lymphedema is treated by surgery to salvage or restore the functioning of an upper extremity. Secondary lymphedema is edema that results from obstruction or destruction of normal lymphatic channels. \n      We may not restrict our determination of the onset of disability to the date of the surgery; we may establish an earlier onset date of disability if the evidence in your case record supports such a finding.\n5.\nCarcinoma-in-situ\n. Carcinoma-in-situ,\n          or preinvasive carcinoma, usually responds to treatment. When we\n          use the term \"carcinoma\" in\n          these listings, it does not include carcinoma-in-situ.\n6.\nPrimary central nervous system (CNS) cancers.\n. We use the criteria in\n13.13\nto evaluate cancers that originate within the CNS \n            (that is, brain and spinal cord cancers).\na. The CNS cancers listed in\n13.13A1\nare highly malignant and respond poorly to treatment, and therefore we do not require additional criteria to evaluate them. \n      We do not list pituitary gland cancer (for example, pituitary gland carcinoma) in\n13.13A1\n,\n    although this CNS cancer is highly malignant and responds poorly to treatment.\n    We evaluate pituitary gland cancer under\n13.13A1\nand do not require additional criteria to evaluate it.\nb. We consider a CNS tumor to be malignant if it is classified as Grade II, Grade III, or Grade IV under the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the CNS (\nWHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, 2007\n).\nc. We evaluate benign (for example, WHO Grade I) CNS tumors under\n11.05\n. \n      We evaluate metastasized CNS cancers from non-CNS sites under the primary cancers (see\n13.00C\n).  \n      We evaluate any complications of CNS cancers, such as resultant neurological or psychological impairments, under the criteria for the affected body system.\n7.\nPrimary peritoneal carcinoma.\nWe use the criteria in\n13.23E\nto evaluate primary peritoneal carcinoma in women because this cancer is often indistinguishable from ovarian\n    cancer and is generally treated the same way as ovarian cancer.\n    We use the criteria in\n13.15A\nto evaluate primary peritoneal carcinoma in men because many of these cases are similar to malignant mesothelioma.\n8.\nProstate cancer.\nWe exclude \"biochemical recurrence\" in\n13.24A\n,\n    which is defined as an increase in the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level following the completion of the hormonal intervention therapy. \n      We need corroborating evidence to document recurrence, such as radiological studies or findings on physical examination.\n9.\nMelanoma.\nWe evaluate malignant melanoma that affects the skin (cutaneous melanoma), eye (ocular melanoma), \n      or mucosal membranes (mucosal melanoma) under\n13.29\n. We evaluate melanoma that is not malignant that affects the skin (benign melanocytic tumor) \n      under the listings in\n8.00\nor other affected body systems.\nL.\nHow do we evaluate cancer treated\n                  by bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, including transplantation using stem cells from umbilical cord blood?\nBone marrow or stem cell transplantation is performed for a variety of cancers. We require the transplantation to occur before we evaluate it under these listings.\n      We do not need to restrict our determination of the onset of disability to the date of the transplantation (\n13.05\n,\n13.06\n, or\n13.07\n) or the date of first treatment under the treatment plan that includes transplantation\n    (\n13.28\n). We may be able to establish an earlier onset date of disability due to your transplantation if the evidence in your case record supports such a finding.\n1.\nAcute leukemia (including T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma)\n                  or accelerated or blast phase of CML\n.\nIf you undergo bone\n          marrow or stem cell transplantation for any of these disorders,\n          we will consider you to be disabled until at least 24 months\n          from the date of diagnosis or relapse, or at least 12 months\n          from the date of transplantation, whichever is later.\n2.\nLymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic phase of CML\n.\nIf you undergo bone marrow or stem cell transplantation for any\n          of these disorders, we will consider you to be disabled until at\n          least 12 months from the date of transplantation.\n3.\nOther cancers\n.\nWe will evaluate any other cancer\n          treated with bone marrow or stem cell transplantation\n          under\n13.28\n, regardless of whether there is another listing that\n    addresses that impairment. The length of time we will consider\n    you to be disabled depends on whether you undergo allogeneic or\n    autologous transplantation.\na.\nAllogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation\n.\nIf you undergo allogeneic transplantation (transplantation from\n          an unrelated donor or a related donor other than an identical twin),\n          we will consider you to be disabled until at least 12 months\n          from the date of transplantation.\nb.\nAutologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation\n.\n          If you undergo autologous transplantation (transplantation of your\n          own cells or cells from your identical twin (syngeneic transplantation)),\n          we will consider you to be disabled until at least 12 months from\n          the date of the first treatment under the treatment plan that includes\n          transplantation. The first treatment usually refers to the initial\n          therapy given to prepare you for transplantation.\n4.\nEvaluating disability after the appropriate time period\n                  has elapsed\n.\nWe consider any residual impairment(s), such\n          as complications arising from:\na. Graft-versus-host (GVH) disease.\nb. Immunosuppressant therapy, such as frequent infections.\nc. Significant deterioration of other organ systems.\nBack to Top",

    "full_text": "14.00 Immune System Disorders\nA.\nWhat disorders do we  evaluate under the immune system disorders listings?\n1.\nWe evaluate immune system disorders that cause dysfunction in one or more components of your immune system\n.\na. The dysfunction may be due to problems in antibody production, impaired cell-mediated immunity, a combined type of antibody/cellular deficiency, impaired phagocytosis, or  complement deficiency.\nb. Immune system disorders may result in recurrent and unusual infections, or inflammation and dysfunction  of the body's own tissues. Immune system disorders can cause a deficit in a  single organ or body system that results in extreme (that is, very serious)  loss of function. They can also cause lesser degrees of limitations in two or  more organs or body systems, and when associated with symptoms or signs, such  as severe fatigue, fever, malaise, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, or involuntary  weight loss, can also result in extreme limitation.\nc. We organize the discussions of immune system disorders in three categories: Autoimmune  disorders; Immune deficiency disorders, excluding human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) infection; and HIV infection.\n2.\nAutoimmune disorders (\n14.00D\n).\nAutoimmune disorders are caused by dysfunctional immune responses directed against the body's own tissues, resulting in chronic, multisystem impairments that differ in clinical manifestations, course, and outcome.\n                            They are sometimes referred to as rheumatic diseases, connective tissue disorders, or collagen vascular disorders. Some of the features of autoimmune disorders in adults differ from the features of the same disorders in children.\n3.\nImmune deficiency  disorders, excluding HIV infection (\n14.00E\n).\nImmune deficiency disorders are characterized by recurrent or unusual infections that respond poorly to  treatment, and are often associated with complications affecting other parts of the body.\n                            Immune deficiency disorders are classified as either\nprimary\n(congenital) or\nacquired\n. Individuals with immune deficiency disorders also have an increased risk of malignancies and of having autoimmune disorders.\n4.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (\n14.00F\n).\nHIV infection may be characterized by increased susceptibility to common infections as well as opportunistic infections, cancers, or other conditions listed in\n14.11\n.\nB.\nWhat information do we need to show that you have an immune system disorder?\nGenerally, we need your medical history, a report(s) of a physical examination, a report(s) of laboratory  findings, and in some instances, appropriate medically acceptable imaging or  tissue biopsy reports to show that you have an immune system disorder.  Therefore, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain your medical history,  medical findings, and results of laboratory tests. We explain the information  we need in more detail in the sections below.\nC.\nDefinitions\n1.\nAppropriate medically  acceptable imaging\nincludes, but is not limited to, angiography, x-ray  imaging, computerized axial tomography (CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), with or without contrast material, myelography, and radionuclear bone  scans. “Appropriate” means that the technique used is the proper one to support  the evaluation and diagnosis of the impairment.\n2.\nConstitutional  symptoms or signs\n, as used in these listings, means severe fatigue, fever,  malaise, or involuntary weight loss.\nSevere fatigue\nmeans a frequent  sense of exhaustion that results in significantly reduced physical activity or  mental function.\nMalaise\nmeans frequent feelings of illness, bodily  discomfort, or lack of well-being that result in significantly reduced physical  activity or mental function.\n3.\nDisseminated\nmeans that a condition is spread over a considerable area. The type and extent  of the spread will depend on your specific disease.\n4.\nDysfunction\nmeans that one or more of the body regulatory mechanisms are impaired, causing  either an excess or deficiency of immunocompetent cells or their products.\n5.\nExtra-articular\nmeans “other than the joints”; for example, an organ(s) such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, or skin.\n6.\nDocumented medical need\nhas the same meaning as in\n1.00C6a\n.\n7.\nFine and gross movements\nhas the same meaning as in\n1.00E4\n.\n8.\nMajor joint of an upper or a lower extremity\nhas the same meaning as in\n1.00I2\nand\n1.00I3\n.\n9.\nPersistent\nmeans that a sign(s) or symptom(s) has continued over time.\n                            The precise meaning will depend on the specific immune system disorder, the usual course of the disorder, and the other circumstances of your clinical course.\n10.\nRecurrent\nmeans that a condition that previously responded adequately to an appropriate course  of treatment returns after a period of remission or regression. The precise  meaning, such as the extent of response or remission and the time periods  involved, will depend on the specific disease or condition you have, the body  system affected, the usual course of the disorder and its treatment, and the  other facts of your particular case.\n11.\nResistant to treatment\nmeans that a condition did not respond adequately to an appropriate course of treatment. Whether a response is adequate or a course of treatment is appropriate will depend on the specific disease or condition you have, the body system affected, the usual course of the disorder and its treatment, and the other facts of your particular case.\n12.\nSevere\nmeans medical severity as used by the medical community.\n                            The term does not have the same meaning as it does when we use it in connection with a finding at the second step of the sequential evaluation processes in\n                            §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\nof this chapter\n.\nD.\nHow do we document and evaluate the listed autoimmune disorders?\n1.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (\n14.02\n).\na.\nGeneral.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can  affect any organ or body system.\n                            It is frequently, but not always, accompanied  by constitutional symptoms or signs (severe fatigue, fever, malaise, involuntary weight loss). Major organ or body system involvement can include:\n                            Respiratory (pleuritis, pneumonitis), cardiovascular (endocarditis,  myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis), renal (glomerulonephritis), hematologic (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), skin (photosensitivity),\n                            neurologic (seizures), mental (anxiety, fluctuating cognition (“lupus fog”), mood  disorders, organic brain syndrome, psychosis), or immune system disorders (inflammatory arthritis).\n                            Immunologically, there is an array of circulating serum auto-antibodies and pro- and anti-coagulant proteins that may occur in a highly variable pattern.\nb.\nDocumentation of SLE.\nGenerally, but not always, the medical evidence will show that your SLE satisfies the criteria in the current “Criteria for the Classification of  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus” by the American College of Rheumatology found in  the most recent edition of the\nPrimer on the Rheumatic Diseases\npublished by the Arthritis Foundation.\n2.\nSystemic vasculitis (\n14.03\n).\na.\nGeneral.\n(i) Vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels. It may occur acutely in association with adverse drug reactions, certain chronic infections, and occasionally, malignancies. More often, it is  chronic and the cause is unknown. Symptoms vary depending on which blood vessels are involved.\n                            Systemic vasculitis may also be associated with other autoimmune disorders; for example, SLE or dermatomyositis.\n(ii) There are several clinical patterns, including but not limited to polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis (aortic arch arteritis), giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis),\n                            and Wegener's granulomatosis.\nb.\nDocumentation of systemic vasculitis.\nAngiography or tissue biopsy confirms a diagnosis of  systemic vasculitis when the disease is suspected clinically.\n                            When you have had angiography or tissue biopsy for systemic vasculitis, we will make every  reasonable effort to obtain reports of the results of that procedure. However, we will not purchase angiography or tissue biopsy.\n3.\nSystemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (\n14.04\n).\na.\nGeneral.\nSystemic sclerosis (scleroderma) constitutes a spectrum of disease in which  thickening of the skin is the clinical hallmark. Raynaud's phenomenon, often  medically severe and progressive, is present frequently and may be the  peripheral manifestation of a vasospastic abnormality in the heart, lungs, and  kidneys. The CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal  dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) is a variant that may slowly  progress over years to the generalized process, systemic sclerosis.\nb.\nDiffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis.\nIn diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (also known as  diffuse scleroderma),\n                            major organ or systemic involvement can include the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart, kidneys, and muscle in addition to skin or blood vessels.\n                            Although arthritis can occur, joint dysfunction results primarily from soft tissue/cutaneous thickening, fibrosis, and contractures.\nc.\nLocalized scleroderma (linear scleroderma and morphea).\n(i) Localized scleroderma (linear scleroderma and morphea) is more common in children than in adults.  However, this type of scleroderma can persist into adulthood.\n                            To assess the  severity of the impairment, we need a description of the extent of involvement of linear scleroderma and the location of the lesions.\n                            For example, linear scleroderma involving the arm but not crossing any joints is not as  functionally limiting as sclerodactyly (scleroderma localized to the fingers).\n                            Linear scleroderma of a lower extremity involving skin thickening and atrophy  of underlying muscle or bone can result in contractures and leg length discrepancy.\n                            In such cases, we may evaluate your impairment under the musculoskeletal listings (\n1.00\n).\n(ii) When there is isolated  morphea of the face causing facial disfigurement from unilateral hypoplasia of the mandible, maxilla, zygoma, or orbit,\n                            adjudication may be more appropriate under the criteria in the affected body system, such as special senses and speech (\n2.00\n)\n                            or mental disorders (\n12.00\n).\n(iii) Chronic variants of these syndromes include disseminated morphea, Shulman's disease (diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia),\n                            and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (often associated with toxins such as toxic oil or contaminated tryptophan), all of which can impose medically severe musculoskeletal dysfunction and may also lead  to restrictive pulmonary disease.\n                            We evaluate these variants of the disease under the criteria in the musculoskeletal listings (\n1.00\n)\n                            or respiratory system listings (\n3.00\n).\nd.\nDocumentation of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).\nDocumentation involves differentiating  the clinical features of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) from other autoimmune  disorders. However, there may be an overlap.\n4.\nPolymyositis and  dermatomyositis (\n14.05\n).\na.\nGeneral.\nPolymyositis and dermatomyositis are related disorders that are characterized by an inflammatory process in striated muscle,\n                            occurring alone or in association with other autoimmune disorders or malignancy. The most common manifestations are symmetric weakness, and less frequently,\n                            pain and tenderness of the proximal limb-girdle (shoulder or pelvic) musculature. There may also be involvement of the cervical, cricopharyngeal, esophageal, intercostal, and  diaphragmatic muscles.\nb.\nDocumentation of polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\nGenerally, but not always, polymyositis is associated with elevated serum muscle enzymes (creatine phosphokinase (CPK),\n                            aminotransferases, and aldolase), and characteristic abnormalities on  electromyography and muscle biopsy. In dermatomyositis there are characteristic skin findings in addition to the findings of polymyositis.\n                            When you have had electromyography or muscle biopsy for polymyositis or dermatomyositis, we will  make every reasonable effort to obtain reports of the results of that  procedure.\n                            However, we will not purchase electromyography or muscle biopsy.\nc.\nAdditional information about how we evaluate polymyositis and dermatomyositis under the listings.\n(i) Weakness of your pelvic girdle muscles that results in your inability to rise independently from a squatting or sitting position or to climb stairs may be an indication that you are unable\n                            to walk without assistance. Weakness of your shoulder girdle muscles  may result in your inability to perform lifting, carrying, and reaching overhead,\n                            and also may seriously affect your ability to perform activities requiring fine movements. We evaluate these limitations under\n14.05A\n.\n(ii) We use the malignant neoplastic diseases listings (\n13.00\n) to evaluate malignancies associated with polymyositis or dermatomyositis.\n                            We evaluate the involvement of other organs/body systems under the criteria for the listings in the affected body system.\n5.\nUndifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease (\n14.06\n).\na.\nGeneral.\nThis listing includes syndromes with clinical and immunologic features of several autoimmune disorders, but which do not satisfy the criteria for any of the specific disorders described. For example, you may have clinical features of  SLE and systemic vasculitis, and the serologic (blood test) findings of  rheumatoid arthritis.\nb.\nDocumentation of undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease.\nUndifferentiated  connective tissue disease is diagnosed when clinical features and serologic (blood test) findings, such as rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibody  (consistent with an autoimmune disorder) are present but do not satisfy the  criteria for a specific disease. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is  diagnosed when clinical features and serologic findings of two or more  autoimmune diseases overlap.\n6.\nInflammatory arthritis (\n14.09\n).\na.\nGeneral.\nThe  spectrum of inflammatory arthritis includes a vast array of disorders that  differ in cause, course, and outcome. Clinically, inflammation of major joints in an upper or lower extremity may be the dominant manifestation causing difficulties with walking or fine and gross movements; there may be joint pain, swelling, and tenderness. The arthritis may affect other joints, or cause less limitation in  walking or fine and gross movements. However, in  combination with extra-articular features, including constitutional symptoms or  signs (severe fatigue, fever, malaise and involuntary weight loss), inflammatory arthritis may result in an extreme limitation.\nb.\nInflammatory  arthritis involving the axial spine (spondyloarthropathy).\nIn adults,  inflammatory arthritis involving the axial spine may be associated with  disorders such as:\n(i) Reiter's syndrome;\n(ii) Ankylosing spondylitis;\n(iii) Psoriatic arthritis;\n(iv) Whipple's disease;\n(v) Behçet's disease; and\n(vi) Inflammatory bowel  disease.\nc.\nInflammatory  arthritis involving the peripheral joints.\nIn adults, inflammatory  arthritis involving peripheral joints may be associated with disorders such as:\n(i) Rheumatoid arthritis;\n(ii) Sjögren's syndrome;\n(iii) Psoriatic arthritis;\n(iv) Crystal deposition  disorders (gout and pseudogout);\n(v) Lyme disease; and\n(vi) Inflammatory bowel  disease.\nd.\nDocumentation of inflammatory arthritis.\nGenerally, but not always, the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis is  based on the clinical features and serologic findings described in the most recent  edition of the Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases published by the Arthritis  Foundation.\ne.\nHow we evaluate inflammatory arthritis under the listings.\n(i) Listing-level severity in\n14.09A\nand\n14.09C1\nis shown by the presence of an impairment-related physical limitation of functioning. In\n14.09C1\n,\n                            if you have the required ankylosis (fixation) of your cervical or dorsolumbar spine, we will find that you have a listing-level impairment-related physical limitation in your ability to see in front of you, above you, and to the side, even though you might not require bilateral upper limb assistance.\n(ii) Listing-level severity in\n14.09B\n,\n14.09C2\n, and\n14.09D\nis shown by inflammatory arthritis that involves various combinations of complications (such as inflammation or deformity, extra-articular features, repeated manifestations, and constitutional symptoms or signs) of one or more major joints in an upper or lower extremity (see\n14.00C8\n) or other joints.\n                            Extra-articular impairments may also meet listings in other body systems.\n(iii) Extra-articular features of inflammatory arthritis may involve any body system; for example:\n                            Musculoskeletal (heel enthesopathy), ophthalmologic (iridocyclitis,  keratoconjunctivitis sicca, uveitis), pulmonary (pleuritis, pulmonary fibrosis or nodules, restrictive lung disease),\n                            cardiovascular (aortic valve insufficiency, arrhythmias, coronary arteritis, myocarditis, pericarditis, Raynaud's phenomenon, systemic vasculitis),\n                            renal (amyloidosis of the kidney), hematologic (chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia), neurologic (peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, spinal cord or cauda equina compression with sensory and motor loss),\n                            mental (cognitive dysfunction, poor memory), and immune system (Felty's syndrome (hypersplenism with compromised immune competence)).\n(iv) If both inflammation and chronic deformities are present, we evaluate your impairment under the criteria of any appropriate listing.\n7.\nSjögren's syndrome (\n14.10\n).\na.\nGeneral.\n(i) Sjögren's syndrome is an immune-mediated disorder of the exocrine glands. Involvement of the lacrimal and salivary glands is the hallmark feature, resulting in symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, and possible complications, such as corneal damage, blepharitis  (eyelid inflammation), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dental caries, and  the inability to speak for extended periods of time. Involvement of the  exocrine glands of the upper airways may result in persistent dry cough.\n(ii) Many other organ systems may be involved, including musculoskeletal (arthritis, myositis),  respiratory (interstitial fibrosis), gastrointestinal (dysmotility, dysphagia,  involuntary weight loss), genitourinary (interstitial cystitis, renal tubular  acidosis), skin (purpura, vasculitis), neurologic (central nervous system  disorders, cranial and peripheral neuropathies), mental (cognitive dysfunction,  poor memory), and neoplastic (lymphoma). Severe fatigue and malaise are frequently  reported. Sjögren's syndrome may be associated with other autoimmune disorders  (for example, rheumatoid arthritis or SLE); usually the clinical features of  the associated disorder predominate.\nb.\nDocumentation of Sjögren's syndrome.\nIf you have Sjögren's syndrome, the medical evidence  will generally, but not always, show that your disease satisfies the criteria  in the current \"Criteria for the Classification of Sjögren's Syndrome\" by the American College of Rheumatology found in the most recent edition of the\nPrimer  on the Rheumatic Diseases\npublished by the Arthritis Foundation.\nE.\nHow do we document and evaluate immune deficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection?\n1.\nGeneral.\na. Immune deficiency  disorders can be classified as:\n(i)\nPrimary\n(congenital);  for example, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, thymic hypoplasia (DiGeorge  syndrome), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), chronic granulomatous  disease (CGD), C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.\n(ii)\nAcquired;\nfor  example, medication-related.\nb. Primary immune deficiency  disorders are seen mainly in children. However, recent advances in the  treatment of these disorders have allowed many affected children to survive  well into adulthood. Occasionally, these disorders are first diagnosed in  adolescence or adulthood.\n2.\nDocumentation of immune deficiency disorders.\nThe medical evidence must include  documentation of the specific type of immune deficiency. Documentation may be  by laboratory evidence or by other generally acceptable methods consistent with  the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\n3.\nImmune deficiency disorders treated by stem cell transplantation.\na.\nEvaluation in the first 12 months.\nIf you undergo stem cell transplantation for your immune  deficiency disorder, we will consider you disabled until at least 12 months  from the date of the transplant.\nb.\nEvaluation after the 12-month period has elapsed.\nAfter the 12-month period has elapsed, we  will consider any residuals of your immune deficiency disorder as well as any  residual impairment(s) resulting from the treatment, such as complications  arising from:\n(i) Graft-versus-host (GVH) disease.\n(ii) Immunosuppressant therapy, such as frequent infections.\n(iii) Significant deterioration of other organ systems.\n4.\nMedication-induced immune suppression.\nMedication effects can result in varying degrees of  immune suppression, but most resolve when the medication is ceased. However, if  you are prescribed medication for long-term immune suppression, such as after  an organ transplant, we will evaluate:\na. The frequency and severity of infections.\nb. Residuals from the organ transplant itself, after the 12-month period has elapsed.\nc. Significant deterioration  of other organ systems.\nF.\nHow do we document and evaluate HIV infection?\nAny individual with  HIV infection, including one with a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency  syndrome (AIDS),\n                            may be found disabled under\n14.11\nif his or her impairment meets the criteria in that listing or is medically equivalent to the criteria in that listing.\n1.\nDocumentation of HIV infection\n.\na.\nDefinitive documentation of HIV infection\n. We may document a  diagnosis of HIV infection by positive findings on one or more of the following  definitive laboratory tests:\n(i) HIV antibody screening test (for  example, enzyme immunoassay, or EIA), confirmed by a supplemental HIV antibody  test such as the Western blot (immunoblot), an immunofluorescence assay, or an  HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.\n(ii) HIV nucleic acid (DNA or RNA)  detection test (for example, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR).\n(iii) HIV p24 antigen (p24Ag) test.\n(iv) Isolation of HIV in viral  culture.\n(v) Other tests that are highly specific for detection of HIV and that are consistent with the prevailing state  of medical knowledge.\nb. We will make every reasonable effort to obtain the results of your laboratory testing.\n                            Pursuant to §§\n404.1519f\nand\n416.919f\n,\n                            we will purchase examinations or tests necessary to make a determination in your claim if no other acceptable documentation exists.\nc.\nOther acceptable documentation of HIV infection\n. We may also document HIV infection without definitive laboratory evidence.\n(i) We will accept a persuasive report from a physician that a positive diagnosis of your HIV infection was confirmed by an appropriate laboratory test(s),\n                            such as those described in\n14.00F1a\n. To be persuasive, this report must state that you had the appropriate definitive laboratory test(s)\n                            for diagnosing your HIV infection and provide the results. The report must also be consistent with the remaining evidence of record.\n(ii) We may also document HIV  infection by the medical history, clinical and laboratory findings, and diagnosis(es) indicated in the medical evidence,\n                            provided that such documentation is consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice and is consistent with the other evidence in your case record. For example, we will accept a diagnosis of HIV infection without  definitive laboratory evidence of the HIV infection if you have an  opportunistic disease that is predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity  (for example, toxoplasmosis of the brain or Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)), and  there is no other known cause of diminished resistance to that disease (for  example, long-term steroid treatment or lymphoma). In such cases, we will make  every reasonable effort to obtain full details of the history, medical findings,  and results of testing.\n2.\nDocumentation of the manifestations of HIV infection\n.\na.\nDefinitive documentation of manifestations of HIV infection\n. We may  document manifestations of HIV infection by positive findings on definitive  laboratory tests, such as culture, microscopic examination of biopsied tissue  or other material (for example, bronchial washings), serologic tests, or on  other generally acceptable definitive tests consistent with the prevailing  state of medical knowledge and clinical practice.\nb. We will make every reasonable  effort to obtain the results of your laboratory testing. \n                            Pursuant to §§\n404.1519f\nand\n416.919f\n,\n                            we will purchase examinations or tests necessary to make a determination of your claim if no other acceptable documentation exists.\nc.\nOther acceptable documentation of manifestations of HIV infection\n.  We may also document manifestations of HIV infection without definitive  laboratory evidence.\n(i) We will accept a persuasive  report from a physician that a positive diagnosis of your manifestation of HIV  infection was confirmed by an appropriate laboratory test(s). To be persuasive,  this report must state that you had the appropriate definitive laboratory  test(s) for diagnosing your manifestation of HIV infection and provide the  results. The report must also be consistent with the remaining evidence of  record.\n(ii) We may also document  manifestations of HIV infection without the definitive laboratory evidence described in\n14.00F2a\n,\n                            provided that such documentation is consistent with the  prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice and is consistent with the other evidence in your case record.\n                            For example, many conditions are now commonly diagnosed based on some or all of the following: Medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings (including appropriate medically acceptable imaging),\n                            and treatment responses. In such cases, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain full details of the history, medical findings, and results of testing.\n3.\nDisorders associated with HIV infection (\n14.11A-E\n)\n.\na.\nMulticentric Castleman disease\n(MCD,\n14.11A\n) affects multiple  groups of lymph nodes and organs containing lymphoid tissue.\n                            This widespread involvement distinguishes MCD from\nlocalized\n(or unicentric) Castleman disease, which affects only a single set of lymph nodes.\n                            While not a cancer, MCD is known as a lymphoproliferative disorder. Its clinical presentation and  progression is similar to that of lymphoma, and its treatment may include radiation or chemotherapy.\n                            We require characteristic findings on microscopic  examination of the biopsied lymph nodes or other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice\n                            to establish the diagnosis. Localized (or unicentric) Castleman disease does not meet or medically equal the criterion in\n14.11A\n,\n                            but we may evaluate it under the criteria in\n14.11H\nor\n14.11I\n.\nb.\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\n(PCNSL,\n14.11B\n) originates in the brain, spinal cord, meninges, or eye.\n                            Imaging tests (for example, MRI) of the brain, while not diagnostic, may show a single lesion or multiple lesions in the white matter of the brain.\n                            We require characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the cerebral spinal fluid or of the biopsied brain tissue,\n                            or other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis.\nc.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma\n(PEL,\n14.11C\n)\n                            is also known as body cavity lymphoma. We require characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the effusion fluid or of the biopsied tissue from the affected internal organ,\n                            or other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis.\nd.\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n(PML,\n14.11D\n) is a progressive neurological degenerative syndrome caused by the John Cunningham\n                            (JC) virus in immunosuppressed individuals. Clinical findings of PML include clumsiness, progressive weakness, and visual and speech changes. Personality and cognitive changes may also occur.\n                            We require appropriate clinical findings, characteristic white matter lesions on MRI, and a positive PCR test for the JC virus in the cerebrospinal fluid to establish the diagnosis.\n                            We also accept a positive brain biopsy for JC virus or other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis.\ne.\nPulmonary Kaposi sarcoma\n(Kaposi sarcoma in the lung,\n14.11E\n) is the most serious form of Kaposi sarcoma (KS).\n                            Other internal KS tumors (for example, tumors of the gastrointestinal tract) have a more variable prognosis.  We require characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage washings,\n                            or of the biopsied transbronchial  tissue, or by other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing  state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis.\n4.\nCD4 measurement (\n14.11F\n).\nTo evaluate your HIV infection under\n14.11F\n, we require one measurement of your absolute CD4 count (also known as CD4 count or CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte count).\n                            This measurement must occur within the period we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disability review.\n                            If you have more than one measurement of your absolute CD4 count within this period, we will use your lowest absolute CD4 count.\n5.\nMeasurement of CD4 and either body mass index or hemoglobin\n(\n14.11G\n).\n                            To evaluate your HIV infection under\n14.11G\n, we require one measurement of your absolute CD4 count or your CD4 percentage,\n                            and either a measurement of your body mass index (BMI) or your hemoglobin. These measurements must occur within the period we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disability review.\n                            If you have more than one measurement of your CD4 (absolute count or percentage), BMI, or hemoglobin within this period, we will use the lowest of your CD4 (absolute count or percentage), BMI, or hemoglobin.\n                            The date of your lowest CD4 (absolute count or percentage) measurement may be different from the date of your lowest BMI or hemoglobin measurement.\n                            We calculate your BMI using the formulas in the digestive disorders body system (\n5.00\n).\n6.\nComplications of HIV infection requiring hospitalization\n(\n14.11H\n).\na. Complications of HIV infection may include infections (common or opportunistic), cancers, and other conditions.  Examples of complications that may result in hospitalization include:  Depression; diarrhea; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome;  malnutrition; and PCP and other severe infections.\nb. Under\n14.11H\n, we require three hospitalizations within a 12-month period that are at least 30 days apart and  that result from a complication(s) of HIV infection.\n                            The hospitalizations may  be for the same complication or different complications of HIV infection and  are not limited to the examples of complications that may result in hospitalization listed in\n14.00F6a\n.\n                            All three hospitalizations must occur  within the period we are considering in connection with your application or  continuing disability review.\n                            Each hospitalization must last at least 48 hours, including hours in a hospital emergency department immediately before the hospitalization.\nc. We will use the rules on medical equivalence in §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\nto evaluate your HIV infection if you  have fewer, but longer, hospitalizations, or more frequent, but shorter, hospitalizations, or if you receive nursing, rehabilitation, or other care in alternative settings.\n7.\nHIV infection manifestations specific to women\n.\na. General. Most women with severe immunosuppression secondary to HIV infection exhibit the typical opportunistic infections and other conditions,\n                            such as PCP,\nCandida\nesophagitis, wasting syndrome, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. However, HIV infection may have different manifestations in women than in men.\n                            Adjudicators must carefully scrutinize the medical evidence and be alert to the variety of medical conditions specific to, or common in, women with HIV infection that may affect their ability to function in the workplace.\nb. Additional considerations for evaluating HIV infection in women. Many of these manifestations (for example, vulvovaginal candidiasis or pelvic inflammatory disease)\n                            occur in women with or without HIV infection, but can be more severe or resistant to treatment, or occur more frequently in a woman whose immune system is suppressed.\n                            Therefore, when evaluating the claim of a woman with HIV infection, it is important to consider gynecologic and other problems specific to women, including any associated symptoms\n                            (for example, pelvic pain), in assessing the severity of  the impairment and resulting functional limitations.\n                            We may evaluate manifestations of HIV infection in women under\n14.11H-I\n, or under the criteria for the appropriate body system\n                            (for example, cervical cancer under\n13.23\n).\n8.\nHIV-associated dementia\n(HAD). HAD is an advanced neurocognitive disorder, characterized by a significant decline in cognitive functioning.\n                            We evaluate HAD under\n14.11I\n. Other names associated with neurocognitive disorders due to HIV infection include: AIDS dementia complex, HIV dementia, HIV encephalopathy,\n                            and major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection.\nG.\nHow do we consider the effects of treatment in evaluating your autoimmune disorder, immune deficiency disorder, or HIV infection?\n1.\nGeneral.\nIf your impairment does not otherwise meet the requirements of a listing, we will consider your medical treatment in terms of its effectiveness in improving the signs,\n                            symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities of your specific immune system disorder  or its manifestations, and in terms of any side effects that limit your functioning.\n                            We will make every reasonable effort to obtain a specific description of the treatment you receive (including surgery) for your immune system disorder. We consider:\na. The effects of medications you take.\nb. Adverse side effects (acute and chronic).\nc. The intrusiveness and complexity of your treatment (for example, the dosing schedule, need for injections).\nd. The effect of treatment on your mental functioning (for example, cognitive changes, mood disturbance).\ne. Variability of your response to treatment (see\n14.00G2\n).\nf. The interactive and cumulative effects of your treatments. For example, many individuals with immune system disorders receive treatment both for their immune system disorders and for the manifestations of the disorders or co-occurring impairments,  such as treatment for HIV infection and hepatitis C. The interactive and  cumulative effects of these treatments may be greater than the effects of each  treatment considered separately.\ng. The duration of your treatment.\nh. Any other aspects of treatment that may interfere with your ability to function.\n2.\nVariability of your response to treatment.\nYour response to treatment and the adverse or  beneficial consequences of your treatment may vary widely. The effects of your  treatment may be temporary or long term. For example, some individuals may show  an initial positive response to a drug or combination of drugs followed by a  decrease in effectiveness. When we evaluate your response to treatment and how  your treatment may affect you, we consider such factors as disease activity  before treatment, requirements for changes in therapeutic regimens, the time  required for therapeutic effectiveness of a particular drug or drugs, the  limited number of drug combinations that may be available for your impairment(s),  and the time-limited efficacy of some drugs. For example, an individual with  HIV infection or another immune deficiency disorder who develops pneumonia or  tuberculosis may not respond to the same antibiotic regimen used in treating  individuals without HIV infection or another immune deficiency disorder, or may  not respond to an antibiotic that he or she responded to before. Therefore, we  must consider the effects of your treatment on an individual basis, including  the effects of your treatment on your ability to function.\n3.\nHow we evaluate the effects of treatment for autoimmune disorders on your ability to function.\nSome medications may have acute or long-term side effects. When we consider the effects of corticosteroids or other treatments for autoimmune disorders on your ability to function,\n                            we consider the factors in\n14.00G1\nand\n14.00G2\n.\n                            Long-term corticosteroid treatment can cause ischemic necrosis of bone, posterior subcapsular cataract, weight gain, glucose intolerance, increased susceptibility  to infection, and osteoporosis that may result in a loss of function.\n                            In addition, medications used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders may also have effects on mental functioning, including cognition (for example, memory), concentration, and mood.\n4.\nHow we evaluate the effects of treatment for immune deficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection, on your ability to function.\nWhen we consider the effects of your treatment for your immune deficiency disorder on your ability to function, we consider the factors in\n14.00G1\nand\n14.00G2\n.  A frequent need for treatment such as intravenous immunoglobulin and gamma interferon therapy can be intrusive and interfere with your ability to work.\n                            We will also consider whether you have chronic side effects from these or other medications, including severe fatigue, fever, headaches, high blood pressure, joint swelling, muscle aches, nausea, shortness of breath,\n                            or limitations in mental function including cognition (for example, memory), concentration, and mood.\n5.\nHow we evaluate the effects of treatment for HIV infection on your ability to function\n.\na.\nGeneral.\nWhen we consider the effects of antiretroviral drugs (including the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART))\n                            and the effects of treatments for the manifestations of HIV infection on your ability to function,\n                            we consider the factors in\n14.00G1\nand\n14.00G2\n.\n                            Side effects of antiretroviral drugs include, but are not limited to: Bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal  intolerance (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neuropathy, rash, hepatotoxicity,\n                            lipodystrophy (fat redistribution, such as “buffalo hump”), glucose intolerance, and lactic acidosis. In addition, medications used in the treatment of HIV infection may also have effects on mental functioning,\n                            including cognition (for example, memory), concentration, and mood, and may  result in malaise, severe fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and insomnia.\n                            The symptoms of HIV infection and the side effects of medication may be  indistinguishable from each other.\n                            We will consider all of your functional limitations, whether they result from your symptoms or signs of HIV infection or the side effects of your treatment.\nb.\nStructured treatment interruptions.\nA structured treatment interruption (STI, also called a “drug holiday”) is a treatment practice during which your treating source advises you to stop taking your medications temporarily. An STI in itself does  not imply that your medical condition has improved; nor does it imply that you  are noncompliant with your treatment because you are following your treating  source's advice. Therefore, if you have stopped taking medication because your  treating source prescribed or recommended an STI, we will not find that you are  failing to follow treatment or draw inferences about the severity of your  impairment on this fact alone. We will consider why your treating source has  prescribed or recommended an STI and all the other information in your case  record when we determine the severity of your impairment.\n6.\nWhen there is no record of ongoing treatment.\nIf you have not received ongoing treatment or  have not had an ongoing relationship with the medical community despite the  existence of a severe impairment(s), we will evaluate the medical severity and  duration of your immune system disorder on the basis of the current objective  medical evidence and other evidence in your case record, taking into  consideration your medical history, symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings,  and medical source opinions. If you have just begun treatment and we cannot  determine whether you are disabled based on the evidence we have, we may need  to wait to determine the effect of the treatment on your ability to function.  The amount of time we need to wait will depend on the facts of your case. If  you have not received treatment, you may not be able to show an impairment that  meets the criteria of one of the immune system disorders listings, but your  immune system disorder may medically equal a listing or be disabling based on a  consideration of your residual functional capacity, age, education, and work  experience.\nH.\nHow do we consider your symptoms, including your pain, severe fatigue, and malaise?\nYour symptoms, including  pain, severe fatigue, and malaise, may be important factors in our determination whether your immune system disorder(s)\n                            meets or medically equals a listing or in our determination whether you are otherwise able to work.\n                            In order for us to consider your symptoms, you must have medical signs or laboratory findings showing the existence of a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be expected to produce the symptoms.\n                            If you have such an impairment(s), we will evaluate the intensity, persistence, and functional effects of your symptoms using the rules throughout\n14.00\nand in our other regulations.\n                            See §§\n404.1521\n,\n404.1529\n,\n416.921\n,\n                            and\n416.929\n.\n                            Additionally, when we assess the credibility of your complaints about your symptoms and their functional effects,\n                            we will not draw any inferences from the fact that you do not receive treatment or that you are not following treatment without considering all of the relevant evidence in your case record,\n                            including any explanations you provide that may explain why you are not receiving or following treatment.\nI.\nHow do we use the functional criteria in these listings?\n1. The following listings in this body system include standards for evaluating the functional limitations resulting from immune system disorders:\n14.02B\n, for systemic lupus erythematosus;\n14.03B\n, for systemic vasculitis;\n14.04D\n, for systemic sclerosis (scleroderma);\n14.05E\n, for polymyositis and dermatomyositis;\n14.06B\n, for undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease;\n14.07C\n, for immune  deficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection;\n14.09D\n, for inflammatory arthritis;\n14.10B\n, for Sjögren's syndrome; and\n14.11I\n, for HIV infection.\n2. When we use one of the listings cited in\n14.00I1\n,\n                            we will consider all relevant information in your case record to determine the full impact of your immune system disorder on your ability to function on a sustained basis.\n                            Important factors we will consider when we evaluate your functioning under these listings include, but are not limited to: Your symptoms, the frequency and duration of manifestations of your immune system disorder,\n                            periods of exacerbation and remission, and the functional impact of your treatment, including the side effects of your medication.\n3. As used in these listings, “repeated” means that the manifestations occur on an average of three times a year, or once every 4 months, each lasting 2 weeks or more; or the  manifestations do not last for 2 weeks but occur substantially more frequently  than three times in a year or once every 4 months; or they occur less  frequently than an average of three times a year or once every 4 months but  last substantially longer than 2 weeks. Your impairment will satisfy this  criterion regardless of whether you have the same kind of manifestation  repeatedly, all different manifestations, or any other combination of  manifestations; for example, two of the same kind of manifestation and a  different one. You must have the required number of manifestations with the  frequency and duration required in this section. Also, the manifestations must  occur within the period covered by your claim.\n4. To satisfy the functional criterion in a listing, your immune system disorder must result in a “marked” level of limitation in one of three general areas of functioning:\n                            Activities of daily living, social functioning, or difficulties in completing tasks due to  deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace.\n                            Functional limitation may result from the impact of the disease process itself on your mental functioning, physical functioning, or both your mental and physical functioning.\n                            This could result from persistent or intermittent symptoms, such as depression, severe fatigue, or pain, resulting in a limitation of your ability to do a task, to concentrate, to persevere at a task,\n                            or to perform the task at an acceptable rate of speed. You may also have limitations because of your treatment and its side effects (see\n14.00G\n).\n5.\nMarked\nlimitation means that the  signs and symptoms of your immune system disorder interfere seriously with your  ability to function. Although we do not require the use of such a scale,  “marked” would be the fourth point on a five-point scale consisting of no  limitation, mild limitation, moderate limitation, marked limitation, and extreme  limitation.\nYou may  have a marked limitation when several activities or functions are impaired, or  even when only one is impaired.  Also, you need not be totally precluded  from performing an activity to have a marked limitation, as long as the degree  of limitation seriously interferes with your ability to function independently,  appropriately, and effectively. The term ‘‘marked’’ does not imply that you  must be confined to bed, hospitalized, or in a nursing home.\n6.\nActivities of daily  living\ninclude, but are not limited to, such activities as doing household  chores, grooming and hygiene, using a post office, taking public  transportation, or paying bills. We will find that you have a “marked”  limitation of activities of daily living if you have a serious limitation in  your ability to maintain a household or take public transportation because of  symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating,  caused by your immune system disorder (including manifestations of the disorder)  or its treatment, even if you are able to perform some self-care activities.\n7.\nSocial functioning\nincludes the capacity to interact independently, appropriately, effectively,  and on a sustained basis with others. It includes the ability to communicate  effectively with others. We will find that you have a “marked” limitation in  maintaining social functioning if you have a serious limitation in social  interaction on a sustained basis because of symptoms, such as pain, severe  fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, or a pattern of exacerbation and  remission, caused by your immune system disorder (including manifestations of  the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to communicate with close  friends or relatives.\n8.\nCompleting tasks in a  timely manner\ninvolves the ability to sustain concentration, persistence,  or pace to permit timely completion of tasks commonly found in work settings.  We will find that you have a “marked” limitation in completing tasks if you  have a serious limitation in your ability to sustain concentration or pace  adequate to complete work-related tasks because of symptoms, such as pain,  severe fatigue, anxiety, or difficulty concentrating, caused by your immune  system disorder (including manifestations of the disorder) or its treatment,  even if you are able to do some routine activities of daily living.\nJ.\nHow do we  evaluate your immune system disorder when it does not meet one of the  listings?\n1. These listings are only  examples of immune system disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent  you from doing any gainful activity. If your impairment(s) does not meet the  criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have an  impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another body system.\n2. Individuals with immune system disorders, including HIV infection, may manifest signs or symptoms of a mental impairment or of another physical impairment. For example, HIV infection may accelerate the onset of conditions such as diabetes or affect the course of or treatment options for diseases such as cardiovascular disease or hepatitis. We may evaluate these impairments under the affected body system.\n3. If you have a severe  medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will  determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n                            (See §§\n404.1526\nand\n416.926\n.)\n                            If it does not, you may or may not have the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity. Therefore, we  proceed to the fourth, and if necessary,\n                            the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in §§\n404.1520\nand\n416.920\n.\n                            We use the rules in §§\n404.1594\n,\n416.994\n,\n                            and\n416.994a\nas appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.\nBack to Top",
